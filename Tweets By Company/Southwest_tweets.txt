its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it's coming, then not. 
you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing? 
nice work on the update! 
We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad. 
won't answer their phones #HorribleService #NeverAgain #frustrated #AnswerThePhone 
Is it a temporary site glitch or are you no longer offering flights from GRR to GEG after Feb? Can't find any online :( 
Guys, we've got to do something about the inability to check in online for international  flight that has... (1/2) 
flight was Cancelled Flightled and it won't let me rebook online. Wait time on phone is too long. Please help 
allows other passengers 2 harass u after their gate agents mistakeFURIOUS they are doing NOTHING about it &amp; my 6yo was scared 
 this is really unhelpful. Why can't I rebook online? http://t.co/N5O43sVl8i 
on hold for 2 hours and then you hung up 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Running out of daycare for our kids who are trapped at home. 
why have you guys jacked up the prices AFTER you said prices were going to be lowered? SMH 
thanks do yall expect to be operational tomorrow out of Nashville? 
husband on hold 2.5 hrs, got disconnected!New wait 30 min. Can't confirm res due to the fact he booked on line! Nuts! 
Hoping you answer the phone today?

the last 4 times I've arrived @LASairport our gate has been blocked by a slow to depart plane leading to 30-60 min delays 
- kind of early but any idea when dates through the first week of sept will come available? 
Guys for real. I've been on hold for 4+ hours including one hangup. Please have someone reach out so I can get my $ back. 
can't update my flight online bc it's been Cancelled Flighted twice already. Going on hour 2 on hold. 
I'm showing flight 4720 delayed again. Would my boarding pass still be good or was my seat given away?

too bad I'm getting this memo: "Your reservation contains modifications that prevent you from changing it online." #FUSTURATED 
 Thank you. 
I'm an A-list Preferred customer and very loyal SWA. However, your inflight wifi is no better today than it was 4 years ago. 
do you not try to get customers to their destinations? No help to get on another airline if you had no flights for 3 days? 
do you think the flights out of Nashville will be Cancelled Flighted tomorrow? 
trying to fly out of Nashville tomorrow. How is it looking? 
kudos to the #RSW CS crew for re-routing PAX to alleviate Over sale due to down graded EQP 800 now 500

any chance of adding LAX-&gt;JFK direct any time in the future? 
Got it, thanks. Any insight into what will happen tomorrow? 
I've been on hold for an hour &amp; a half trying to change my flight to BNA. Not very happy with customer service right now!!!!!!

damn weather messing up everything #serenitynow 
- any update on flights in to BNA today? 
Great job!! Looking forward to my next trip being able to use this new feature! 
@SouthwestAir condescension must be a quality your co rewards. Your tone reeks of it 
I need to reschedule a flight and I've been on hold for almost an hour. This is ridiculous. Is there a best number to call? 
Great job with the Passbook integration! It‚Äôll really help streamline the commute to San Fran! üòä‚òïüì≤‚úà 
@challemann flying to LGA in the dead of winter? #jvstatus EWR &amp; JFK is always the intelligent option.

45mins wait on the phone with no option for a callback? Finally had to hang up because my phone was dying. #customerservice 
why are flights still getting out of Logan now? You couldn't manage to get one out at 6 AM, when it wasn't snowing! 
Thanks. Yes I got through. Biggest frustration is that I'm no longer able to check in online for my flight after 4 Cancelled Flights. 
I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours? 
can you follow me? Flight Cancelled Flightled, can't rebook online, been on hold for 2 hours.  Would love to DM flight info. Thank you.

I am following you now. I don't think I can DM until you follow me. 
or you could send me a DM. 
worst customer service, Terrible attitudes. I don't care how big a storm.  Your employees need an attitude adjustment 
followed. 
Already rebooked for tomorrow. Fingers crossed! 
@BernhardtJH I did eventually get through but that flight Cancelled Flightled.  Decided to drive but gave up holding to process refund 
yes. Thank you. Oct 25-oct 31 
You need to be more accommodating to your loyal customers. Not happy now! 
Almost 2 hours on hold now. I just need to Cancelled Flight a flight and get a refund. Other airlines are operating! 
flt 648 from Buf to MCO. Conf#FGKXV5. Please also look into reimburse for car 587701925COUNT that I had to Cancelled Flight 
please send me a number to call to talk to a person and not be put on hold 
no had to rebook my flight myself and am about to board in bham. 
there really should not be guidance to call via phone if you are that back logged. I could have done it online in 3 minutes. 
how about when there are Cancelled Flightlations you just have a link to rebook like you did for initial storm issues? 
can someone help me set up a callback today? 
the person I talked to couldn't do anything not normally available online other than the "no charge" part. 
also, they said they couldn't even book the flight. They were having to put me on hold &amp; have someone else do it??? 
not terribly inspired to call "customer service" in the future now. 
no worries. We got thru eventually. I was just curious. Best of luck to you dealing with the weather! 
and currently as im bringing my 3 year old to the bathroom I'm being rushed by the flight attendant. 
I will.make sure to tell everyone I know about this all around horrible experience. I will also post it on my business page. 
Happily! But you need to follow me in order for me to DM you 
Heard apology ~45 times in the &gt;60 mins I was on hold. Now flying from another airport at a different time but delayed AGAIN 
in my 30 years of flying I have never been so pissed off.  To many incidents for just one flight. 
no worries. You're doing the best u can. Already Cancelled Flighted my biz trip. Still $LUV you! -RR 1079871763 
I absolutely will. Where can I send it? 
I understand a delay but to be stuck on the plane longer than the flight is unacceptable 
Hey SWAir- a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time. 
they put me on the next flight available.. tomorrow morning :( Any idea if BNA will be open in the morning for my flight? 
super disappointed today. First time we've had to stress and now book a flight on another airline while at the airport 
RDU flights expected to be ok this afternoon and tonight? 
@PaytonTaylor129 I love Southwest and Payton Taylor! 
is there a problem with the website? I tried making changes w/ the app and the site but got "unspecified errors" 
Buying Early Bird was pointless. You moved me to a diff flight b/c first one was delayed, so I lost my boarding position. 
was earlier, for reFlight Booking Problems flight I'm on now. Didn't get a screencap, just said "unspecified error" and to call SWA 
the woman working the counter in philly at 630 this am needs to be fired. Due to bad weather, I along with other passengers 
I think I'm shot. Can't find a flight that arrives before business (SAN) on thu. Really want to go too. 
thanks, got put on the am flight tomorrow.  Don't have much faith it'll get off the ground tomorrow though. 
Ive had on an airline. Everyone else has been great but she soured the whole experience for me. Hope she's not there next time 
- I have spent 87 minutes (and counting) on hold w/ you today. After first 48 minutes, I gave up. Trying again &amp; on 43rd min. 
finally got through. Thanks! 
why are you the ONLY airline that is not flying out of BNA today? 
@CBSsoxfan you get to hold? called twice only to be kicked off.calls 3-6 #phonedied #AListpreferred http://t.co/1TZZ0vbMbS 
an entire flight of luggage missing at #dca.  Over an hour and nobody knows anything. 
I recommend upgrading your IVR and using call back, email, and texting from a know caller. 
Another great flight &amp; crew, Las Vegas-Chicago #3397. Thanks! 
Your onboard wifi is so bad it's taking me 20 minutes to send this tweet.  Working is off the table. #disappointed 
just did, thank you 
Received email w/reso's to my email that isn't associated to SWA account I own with CC info for my sister. #FRAUD please DM me 
do you do auto callbacks so I don't have to wait on hold? 
your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this 
good thing we noticed because she had re-routed 7 total passengers on an impossible triple connection as well 
Just sent you a DM with the details. 
please PM me the number where I can lodge formal complaints. Thx 
got it squared away. Thank you. I had a man on the inside help me out! 
chances of flight leaving BNA tomorrow at 6:20 am (to LGA)? 
 Tried to DM you, it won't let me as it says you are not following me. 
thank you for the response. How can I got about getting the points onto my rewards account? 
we desparately need yall to make a nonstop BNA-&gt; TUL! Cmon it'll be popular. üòÑ (right, @annebevi @PaulBev1  @MikeAbramson??) 
I got a flight at 11:55am on Thursday but looking for something tomorrow, anything available? 
right but the point was that my kids don't fly often, but I do. I bought four round trip tickets from DtW to PHX so I'm.... 
missing out on over 6,000 points in one account. They're now spread over four assuming I create accounts for them 
from LGA to San Diego 
thanks I think we've got it figured out

Thanks for the response. Was able to get my situation resolved. Not a fan of Mother Nature today. :)

Nashville airport has runways open. It appears southwest is only airline Cancelled Flighting flights. Is this likely to change? 
Hi there! I just got my known traveler# and would like to add it to a flight that I already purchased. What's my best option? 
been with my GF for 2.5yrs, she's from SF &amp; I live in Tulsa. SWA always takes me there to see my love! #SouthwestLuvSweeps 
How? It is not possible to call SWA on the phone. You put me on hold for an hour and then cut me off. 
not yet! Supposed to get it early evening tonight. Don't want to have to go to the store and buy new necessities. 
I understand. Wonderful "Miriam" in customer service who was able to reroute me... Got any rental car discounts? 
still on the ground &gt;30mins after planned departure. And this is California. No weather here. Originally told 10 min delay. 
my flight was Cancelled Flightled Monday.  Just looking to Cancelled Flight and credit my card.  That's all. 
WiFi on yesterday's flight extremely slow a waste of $8 and lost the travel time for work. 
Having some trouble checking in. Can you please add me so I can DM you

Thanks a lot southwest! 
I'm scheduled to come back tomorrow, finally but I don't know SWA hasn't flown out of @Fly_Nashville yet but @Delta has 
your social media team just said "sorry". Thankfully submitting a complaint got resolution from an amazing rep who called. 
When are you going to be flying in and out of Nashville? The Deicer is in. Are you short on planes and is it tomorrow morning? 
Amazing customer service as well. Will definitely fly with you guys again if my instrument is involved. #10/10 
When do you all expect to open the reservation through November? 
had to rebook through Atlanta &amp; now drive to #Nashville. Had to pay ridiculous price difference. Bad weather good for business 
Fastest response all day. Hour on the phone: never got off hold. Hour in line: never got to the Flight Booking Problems desk. 
think you need to follow me for a DM 
You officially have the worst customer service of any airline I've ever dealt with. #southwestairlines #poor 
TREMENDOUS job. Atlanta Airport saw SW celebrate Mardi Gras. Another reason I'm nuts for you guys! http://t.co/8WBzOrRn3C 
You guys must have been swamped, even took our corporate travel a long time to get in, but everything worked out in the end.

what are the chances you will be Cancelled Flighting all flights in and out of Nashville again? 
who should I contact about a missing Rapid Rewards credit? 
can you outline the policies for both scenarios? 
According to TV passenger interviews, the landing was far from "uneventful" with heavy (panic) breaking to 
I was in Nashville and I had to drive 3 and a half hours to Memphis, but I made it as the plane was loading! 
Hey yea I got thru...everything is good now (well, in 7-10 days when the voucher goes through)  Appreciate it! 
Why won't you let me leave Newark!? 
no self help way to put in tsa pre check number for existing reservation. Very annoying. 800 is not reachable. 
thanks for your assistance..you guys ROCK!!üíØ 
 you are over 40, please start acting your age and stop with the short-shorts! 
all good now. Going to make it to Boston on time. I'm actually on your wifi right now 
very frustrated with your customer service.Open seats on earlier flight, $154 to change. What a rip off!! 
I'm Flight Booking Problems a flight to Vegas. Any good promo codes?? 
she made it standby after her flight was Cancelled Flighted for no reason. Almost 4hrs Late Flight.  Conf#¬†FVF9YW  SWRR#¬†298033455 
Glad it was finally resolved too. Too bad I can't get a free voucher to go with mine so I can have a friend travel next time! 
you're 4/4 on blowing it with your customer service. Shotwest Airlines. 
can u better define the "plus one smaller type" item on carry on requirements?.. small backpacks? 
I appreciate that, and not to be rude, but it doesn't solve much. You should AT LEAST cover the cost of stolen goods. 
thanks!! We will see what happens!! 
thank you for your help resolving my problem Shannon ROCKS - even though Rhonda didn't !! 
can't believe how many paying customers you left high and dry with no reason for flight Cancelled Flightlations Monday out of BDL! Wow. 
my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE 
please help on hold forever to check in for flight 
Got it covered. Thanks! 
can't wait! Thanks for the response!‚ù§Ô∏è 
I did ....it's just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted. 
Finally got through after 3 hours and all set. Thanks. 
thanks for your excellent response time and assistance! All set :) 
My luggage has still not been found. Luggage is not scanned until final destination. So no way of knowing where it is! 
- total win!! Happy 7th bday on intercom, chocoLate Flight kisses, and a chance to hand out snacks.Thank you. http://t.co/NKloZcNtto 
 Tried to leave Monday, all other planes left but mine. Now this one keeps getting delayed. Missed work. Have to pay for a cab 
No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone. 
  Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait! 
I left my iPad on my flight 1831 from ERW to DEN. I opened claim 442998. It has so many memories on it. Plz help get it back. 
this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport. Each time communicated Late Flight by SW 
big thanks to your team. family emerg, same day ticket, experience was excellent. 1st time flying with yall, not my last! 
has the best customer service!

Flight 4146 Phi to Den was staffed by a great crew. #freecomedyshow #newlifetimecustomer 
really enjoying sitting at BWI with the door wide open and the a/c on as they fix a "baggage error" #sarcasm 
It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft 
I need some help with a reservation 
snow forecasted for Raleigh NC tomorrow night. Need to know if there's a plan to reschedule flights into RDU Wednesday night 
update 35 minutes into this pilot has turned off a/c. No longer freezing, but we are enjoying waiting for reload of all bags 
I am scheduled for the morning, 2 days after the fact, yes..not sure why my evening flight was the only one Cancelled Flightled 
where are our bags?
We have a tv show to film!! 
hot stewardess flipped me off 
A wonderfully nice agent in Austin helped us out. Wish I remembered her name to give proper kudos. 
Once again, I was able to change my flight without any fees... oh and the two free checked bags.  Best airline ever. 
I'm trying to get home to Nashville. I've been stuck in Dallas 2 days will my flight get out in the morning 
you are the #Official airlines of #DivadaPouch aka #ThePoopQueen http://t.co/XXY2d2iMnP 
@JohnWayneAir Thank you both very much!! 
my bag was Late Flight-checked and put on a different flight from OAK-&gt;MSY. Having troubles tracking it down. Any help? 
What are your services? What promotion you have at the moment? #ModeloDeNegocio #innovation #innovacion #BusinessModel 
neveind, it's been found and on its way. Thanks for making the process so painless 
75 minutes and still waiting for skis to be unloaded. You should be ashamed. It's 1:30 in the morning. 
@TinaIsBack I'm so sorry for your frustration. Did you get rebooked? ^SW‚Äù I've been rebooked 4 times!! Still stuck!! #SMH 
Had a bad experience with them last week.  They broke my bicycle that I had brought with me to do a bike ride in Fla.  Why? 
will you please tell me if I'll make my flight out of here tomorrow 8am? I've been tryin for 3 days now to leave 
@SouthwestAir hi! get a solar charger from Amazon! Game changer to plug usb into charge. :) 
@CourtSnod hopefully Nashville is open. I want to come home today 
why is your website downnnnn :( ugh 
 flight at 630 from fll kiosk just opened. Rude attendants because now everyone is Late Flight. http://t.co/2Boh2Mh3cb 
I love and appreciate the fact that you guys rarely Cancelled Flight flights and are on time, but I need a Cancelled Flightlation this time. üôè 
Today is going to be the day, I can feel it!  Thank y'all for your support throughout! We're coming home Nashville! #Octavia 
Thanks for reminding me about my upcoming trip to Florida but you really didn't need to... http://t.co/p6r5rt5Ow5 
so was there a winner for #DestinationDragons ??? 
any delays today @CAKairport to Orlando? 
THANK YOU for finally making your boarding passes work with passbook 
de-icing is important! 
Hi, how do I add a flight to my account? Just created it 
Not possible to carry-on and put in a closet/overhead? Had success doing that with other airlines. Thanks 
for the win as always- saved my day and got me on a direct to Orlando. üéâüéâüéâ 
just did last night. Thanks for following up. :) 
thanks for getting me back to Nashville. Big thanks to the pilots on the 6:15 out of Baltimore. Flying in snow landing on ice.

when will you have flights for October 2015 available? 
Flight 4110 MCO to ISP delayed. Any details on why? 
Oh no worries NL, no disappointments here. Better to have NO lounges than like #Delta who has them but does disappoint! 
I couldn't fly you today &amp; it made the trip harder + had to pay for my checked bag. #DevotedyYours but for today. :( 
I just sent a screen shot of the incident report. 
first time flyer, scheduled a (round)trip. set on departure date not sure on returning date, policy/fees on changing Re Flight 
@DeltaPoints hey at least you guys are honest with your customers unlike @Delta 
FS4VE7 when I corrected the attendants error she gave me attitude made a rude show of taking back nuts&amp; said "well i was Late Flight" 
Thanks for the info! Have a good day. 
Thanks I just sent a DM with this info. 
when will you be accepting reservations past August 7? 
Landed in Nashville! Thanks for taking care of us! http://t.co/RYXbPLgMnK 
I am completely displeased with the service I received on yesterday flying from LGA to ATL. 
First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate 
2 bags fly free!  So what's with all the carry-on's? #packingayak @BrianReganComic 
Secondly, we did not begin boarding on time despite our aircraft being present and deplaned. Thus we left over 30 min Late Flight 
Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour! 
took delivery of N8661A, a new Boeing 737-8H4 yesterday. http://t.co/5z9STyUQJ3 #DFW #DAL #airlines 
I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage. 
We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation. 
So today I call into Customer Service &amp; speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office &amp; I am told there is nothing he can do 
All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused. 
please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection 
looking for cheap flight to vegas 
This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse 
I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I'm astounded at the lack of concern about customer's flying experiences. 
Therefore, since I've received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow. 
Finally got me home #BNASnow 
By the way the flight number was 1703, please feel free to fact check my complaints about leave time &amp; baggage time. 
Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero. 
In my letters to follow, I will be sure to include my Rewards Number, twitter handle, and email address. 
Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns. 
Thank you for your time! 
There is no option just to Cancelled Flight? I don't want to change flight, I want to Cancelled Flight. 
Thank you! 
really?!? 1.5 hours ON THE PLANE and at the gate??? Jax2BNA. Like we haven‚Äôt waited days to get home #notokay 
why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes? 
Hi! Just got my TSA pre-check # &amp; put it in my acct. But it's not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.Can it be updated? 
I left something on a plane landing at Midway last night because I am a responsible adult -- got a number for me to call? TY! 
Awesome!!! Sending now. 
I want to file a formal complaint against a disgruntled employee @ LaGuardia who ruined mltple people's travel plans yesterday 
she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs! 
TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn‚Äôt enough. #freedrinkcoupons 
Ahhhh! Sorry, just followed. 
pleasantly surprised to be boarding my flight on time this morning at @Fly_Nashville. Good job! 
when are you opening the flights beyond august 7th??? 
boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn't our plane. Now an hour delay. üò≠üò≠ 
OH MY GOSH SERIOUSLY?! you just made my day, week, year!!! No one will appreciate this more than me!!! 
can @Sagerooski &amp; I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot @ home is not accurate anymore. 
yea but I was hoping to avoid the ticket difference amount as a birthday courtesy? #flysouthwest #lovesouthwest #mybday 
No I have not. 
Sorry! Thought I did. It's done now.

@love_dragonss LAUREN OMG BEST AIRLINE EVER 
I've never met my favorite band and it would be sooo amazing to win destination dragons. 
Customer relations line had busy signal too, called the normal line and the service rep thought I was dumb for not knowing. 
you're the best 
@love_dragonss LAUREN OMG IM DEAD IM SO SO HAPPY FOR YOU YES YES 
@love_dragonss LAUREN IM SCREAMING 
I just wanted Southwest to know that I don't think they're as great as I used to anymore. Nothing to look into. 
it would be nice if I could talk to an agent rather than get caught up w/ a promotion &amp; then be hung up on 
Service rep didn't say I was dumb just had the tone of voice like I should have known about it. 
@love_dragonss oh my gosh 
thank you!!! 
is offering #CompanionPasses to Atlanta residing frequent fliers! http://t.co/mdN5ED58ze 
 Southwest is currently awaiting government approval for this route. Do we know when it will be official? 
Yes! I did and the bags came straight to my hotel. Thank you ...you guys rock! 
Southwest is scheduled to fly to Costa Rica on March 7 but I can't book it online. When will this be available? 
now it's delayed until 3:55. Getting yelled at by attendants not to bother them. Getting worse 
it's ok...I forgive you guys. 
LOVE your TV ad with the girl dancing. Makes me laugh every time, AND now I want to take a trip! :-) 
how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn't want to wait their turn can get a slip?

When does the new schedule open that takes us past 10/31? 
is there anything I can do to get tickets for @Imaginedragons at @VinylVegas? It would mean so much to me #DestinationDragons 
please expedite missing bag claim #3526665682. Thanks! 
Any possible chance of SWA bringing back service between LGA-BWI? It would make it much easier to connect to the west coast. 
I don't have a conference number.  I spoke with Courtney in Texas and David before that. they finally fixed mine after an hour 
how do i know that my information is not found on other people's account?  I can see someone else's reservation, rr # and trip

I understand weather is not your fault, but as a frequent flyer I expected better customer service. I'll be trying @Delta 
Thanks!!! :)  It is good to air on the side of caution 
One heck of an airline http://t.co/CyoOnZfTdC

Yes - with extra $77. I wonder what are you going yo loose, if there is room. 
Looks like 'On February 19, 2015, we will open our schedule for sale through October 30, 2015' - know what time that will be?

why the delay on Flight 423 BDL to MCO? Need to get to Florida for the ‚òÄÔ∏è&amp; races in Daytona

 do you know where my plane is coming from?  I'm on SW flight 4464 from RSW to MKE 
If you read my tweet it is a gap in process for folks that take multiple flights in one day.

Congratulations! 
Southwest is definitely my favorite airline to fly! :D 
Is there an email address I can send some thoughts to? This experience was really not good &amp; I have some feedback. 
Hi Guys good morning how are you doing 
@FortuneMagazine I DO like your airlines, congrats! : ) 
MAC computer left on BWI to LA flight on 14th.  Reward for recovery; info important to owner.#HELP #passengers #honesty 
would you be willing to help me surprise my bestfriend with tickets to go see @Imaginedragons? #DestinationDragons Gracias! 
used to exclusively fly SW, but Late Flightly, direct flights &amp; cheaper costs have me switched. üòî why...so... few...direct...flights? 
is it possible to book a refundable trip? Willing to pay extra. This would be for a domestic round trip flight 
nothing express about your express bag drop at Phoenix Sky Harbor 
@FortuneMagazine Love flying Southwest! Best flight attendants ever! 
@FortuneMagazine Love u Southwest. You've always been helpful. When I traveled a lot w/my son, infant/toddler, U were great! 
is there any chance I could get tickets to the #DestinationDragons show in Vegas? Ive been a huge fan for years! Pretty please 
For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would love a bday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines. 
@FortuneMagazine Congratulations! 
to @SouthwestAir , I get to go to the #DestinationDragons @Imaginedragons show this weekend in UTAH @VelourLive  !!! #ThankYou 
Thank you for the prompt response. I will email Late Flightr today. 
I wish I would've known so I could've slept 2 hours more and let my friend know not to wait for me after she lands... 
oh my god thank you so much!!! I just sent you a DM 
sure can! Just a second. 
I paid for inflight wifi only for it not to work. Download speed was 0.21mbps &amp; I ended up watching the free TV instead. 
Incredibly frustrating. I emailed but still haven't received a response. 
. I don't like the new schedule. No more nonstops from PHL to FLL or PBI? We are not free to move between those cities. Sad. 
@jlittle100 Double up with this comment. PHL to anywhere South Florida is GONE GONE GONE. Hello US Air 
listening center is open seating just like on their planes. #RaganDisney 
has 22 employees on Social Care Team, 4 staff the Listening Ctr. at any time-rest of spots filled by other areas. #RaganDisney 
@FortuneMagazine Superb choice - SWA. I am a raving fan. They even take stress out of weather-reLate Flightd glitches!  #custexp 
Every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is FULL. Still hard to believe. Fly 8 hours thru ATL?NO 
unfortunately no, it's my lack of status that's the big problem. My company policy forces me to buy the cheapest tickets 
I got a phishing email claiming to be from Southwest. I can forward to you if you'd like to investigate. 
@FortuneMagazine friendliest employees 
@FortuneMagazine I always tell everyone to fly Southwest! Congratulations!!! 
please please please choose me to go see @Imaginedragons   #DestinationDragons 
@FortuneMagazine well deserved! 
@FortuneMagazine Congrats! 
SW rocks, thanks for the reply and the follow. Rebooked earlier flight! 
@FortuneMagazine. I'm flying on one right this minute 
question all.  When will I receive my yearly bonus point accumulation? I think it's around now but not sure.  Thanks! :)

RUDE gate agent. Wholly unacceptable to us &amp; other passengers. Think this will be our last time on sw. 
rude customer svc, won't accommodate an earlier flight w/o $400 charge. US Mail takes priority over customers. #badservice 
Can someone rebook me? Please direct message me. 
My DM won't go through but it is 261633561838. Please let me know if you need anything else. 
I already follow you and can't DM because u need to follow me back 
real sincere apology! Makes my day! Glad to know flying mail is more important than me. Never flying SW again! #badservice

I can easily get to the Atlanta show, I just need tickets, help?! 
thank you!!! #bringbacktheluvtordu #miami #directflights 
..just booked trip to Cancun...‚ù§Ô∏è no baggage fees..but need to have more flight time options 
wouldn't it be awesome for my first time flying to be #DestinationDragons?! 
I owe you an apology. My tweet was out of frustration, not constructive criticism. I'm a SW fan &amp; LOVE your service! 
Again, please accept my apologies for my lame, childish tweet. You didn't deserve that, &amp; I remain a LOYAL SW customer! 
A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I've had. What's up? 
I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn't there be some sort of compensation? 
Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular. 
are there any flights from MSP to HRL in March? I'm looking at 3/19-3/23 
this inflight WIFI is the absolute worst. I'd be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds...  #Flight7 
is really stepping up their "service"üê© http://t.co/VQTyza6Mzu 
no flights to HRL :( is this a limited route? 
great news for @PortColumbusCMH today. Finally, Columbus' top unserved market will have flights. 
Why doesn't mean TSA PreCheck show up on my mobile boarding pass? My KTN is linked to my account. 
yes can do 
thank you for always going above and beyond with your customer service!!!!!! #favoriteairline #luvforSW #southwestAir 
great cabin and flight crew this morning on #578. A great smile and happy staff are signs of a happy company. Thanks. 
is the best airline out there no one is better than them #OneLove #Southwest #bestairline 
AMAZING c/s today by SW thank you SO very much. This is the reason we fly you #southwest 
This is unbelievable... Thank you so much! #DestinationDragons 
surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm.  Broken down equipment. 
Report was filed but would like to support some active searching.  Feels pretty passive now.  Info on computer is precious. 
@BrittanyOBX11, keeping families apart w/ your quirky, archaic policies. Any other airline accommodates in this situation. 
you need to get your act together. You new this morning at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. Yet I've been delayed 3 times .. 
not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You've ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation. 
and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It's scheduled for 455 
there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be Flight Booking Problems southwest again.. 
yeehaw. You found us another plane.  Thx for listening to me vent. 
if this flight is Cancelled Flighted or delayed any further I expect full compensation for my park ticket, hotel &amp; flight.. 
is awful. They have lost my bag and aren't providing any info. This is day 3 and nothing. #WORSTAIRLINEEVER 
 3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter 
now flying non stop CMH-OAK has me daydreaming about a trip to the bay...especially in this weather. #OhioProbz 
I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using.

why must the 4:45pm nonstop BOS-BNA flight stop running after August 7??? 
Scott is the best!!! Thank yo from the bottom of my heartüíï#DestinationDragons with friends in LA @HayleyMad see u Friday 
Is your BWI-SJD service seasonal? Wasn't part of extension. Called intl desk. They didn't know. Want to fly in Sept on Sat.

#DestinationDragons @Imaginedragons I'm a HUGE FAN! I would love tix to your show! 
A-List Pref credit card holder called exclusive # and hung up after on hold for 14 min. What gives??? 
@Imaginedragons #DestinationDragons Any tix to spare? I wanna go see the show on Friday in LA with my friend @HayleyMad! 
What's with the pricing cache?! About to book a flight, refreshed the page, &amp; the price jumped from $73 to $159. Ridiculous. üòë 
your A-list program is a complete JOKE! Your company does not value loyal customers.Time to look for another "go-to" airliner 
Do you perhaps have a pair to the Atlanta show? #prettyplease 
please help me get tickets to the @Imaginedragons club show in Atlanta?! #DestinationDragons 
suggestion- shades on the windows @KCIAirport so travelers won't have to watch ur luggage handlers throwing their bags around 
do you have a pair of tickets to the @Imaginedragons show in Atlanta?! I'd love to go! #DestinationDragons 
thanks for your attention, I've been flying southwest for 3 years and haven't had this issue in the past. 
can I get some luv with a fallow? 
Thanks I get that. It looks like all BWI-SJD services stops after Aug 7. Is that the case? I cant find one date with flights. 
for my travel I see bz class and get away are sld out. Anytime is available . How do I know how many anytime are available? 
do you have any flights from NAS-BWI ton March 23? 
I was just sitting here talking at a tech conference about how awesome you guys are and this rolled across. Luv you guys! #LOL 
never got any notification that flight 955 was Cancelled Flighted today. Correct phone # and email on file. Not a happy customer. 
Yes. Please train your customer service agents with correct protocol.. I should not be receiving different 411 evrytime I call 
Don't worry, you will! :-) 
no one has answers...no one can help. There is always a different story to why my and my fiancee' can't be helped. 
for your loyal A-list customers it should be easier to get help and bring resolution to issues with your rewards program. 
thanks a lot for sending a "special deal" with @Budget. Getting screwed is the best when on vacation #sarcasm get new partners 
you should know the crew today on flight #1071 AUS to PDX was awesome! #SWA 
Thank you. Great tool 
wow! Some things are better forgotten! 
Unable to check in my flight. It says my itinerary is ineligible for checkin online. Go to counter. Very inconvenient!!! 
Yes I can. But you guys should get your act together. 
PWM direct to Orlando on Saturdays, why is this only happening in March? I thought it was going to be a permanent thing. :(

My boyfriend and I have LOVED @Imaginedragons since 2009 &amp; it would be so awesome to go to Vegas event. Any way you can help? 
just announced non-stop flights to Dallas from Columbus. Well next time @iGotMonte best you'll have less time airport hopin üòÇüòÇ 
why doesn't your terminal B in LGA have pre-check? Makes me want to never fly your airline 
thanks for the b day concert I watched them all (and noticed the fist bump/high five at the end of the "rock" version) 
any idea if there will be any "spring sales" soon for travel from Late Flight August to early September? Going from PA to LAX.

almost bumped me off my flight to HRL when I was 20 minutes early then your staff was rude when I asked what was the problem?

My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It's a lowercase team day. 
YOU ARE THE EASIEST AIRLINE TO DEAL WITH.. I LOVEEEE YOU SO MUCH 
truly the best in #customerservice.  If something goes wrong, no matter how big or small the issue was, they fix it. Thank you 
might be the worst airline ever 
Problem is, I wasn't issued a position until today at the gate. And no option to upgrade. Not good when you're 6'4. 
don't ever tweet me again 
:( Thanks for the opportunity... 
@pancho_joe No, no, you must've heard us wrong. Sweet mixtape,though" 4 the record,I didn't leave the 80's, the 80's left me

Did yall get rid of the Austin to Cabo flights all together? There's zero non-stop in Aug and Sept 
yall say flt 4200 is on time, yet we haven't boarded for a 3:35 departure b/c we are waiting on a new crew. Why the subterfuge

Any way you can help with entry to Vegas event? My Boyfriend &amp; I have been @Imaginedragons fans since 2009. They are awesome! 
How do I enter passport information on an existing reservation before check in?

love how you hold flight 2851 in PHX for Late Flight passengers and make us all over an hour Late Flight. Great job. 
good to know. Perhaps it was execution then. 
on #unscheduled aircraft change, please have a better system in place, not worth the paid upgrade. #REFUND

why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me. 
the crew of SWA 4007 a high five from this AV-8B guy for its nice XW landing into @bostonlogan. Nicely done! 
Is there any way to get entry to the Las Vegas event to see @Imaginedragons perform? #DestinationDragons 
is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc! 
Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it. 
Your crew on 4028 tonight was outstanding. God bless them and the medically trained passengers on board. 
please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent. 
I have a roundtrip ticket now and I need to change one leg of the trip (to a nearby airport) - not possible via website? 
why can't you help me after you made mistake and dropped my early bird check in on your end?  Where is the LUV? 
where is the great customer service I have come to know/expect; you LUV dropped by EB check in and no help in sight! 
 I look forward to those direct flights to California to see my family more often. Thank you @MichaelBColeman #byebyeusairline

seems like you could make more money by opening up seats on a more desirable flight. 
what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice 
Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min.... 
Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels 
because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log. 
now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter 
I figured the streaming wouldn't work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load 
you know I ‚ù§Ô∏èyou but trying my patience - had easier cheaper ways from TPA to PDX but stuck w u. Turned my 3 hrs in MCI to 6

after 4 hours of delays you did make a nice offer for rescheduling me the next day... but... 
it'd be nice if I could get an answer, even a simple "no" would do; I just want to know. :) 
Just realized my Luv Voucher expired today. :( Any chance of getting some luv with an extension? Please? #VeryLoyalCustomer

give me tickets to atlanta! I would do anything!  Anything üòÜ 
I notice that there are separate buttons for "guitar" and actual "music" in this pic. Some bands should take note of this. 
Can you help me out with tickets to the Vegas event? I would be so stoked! 
appreciate the reply, hopefully those LAX agents get the memo. Cheers! 
would be cool if the best airlines company hooked me up with @Imaginedragons tickets for Vegas ;) 
 Just picked up my bag at SEATAC all the clothes are soaking wet... #bagawim http://t.co/nGxAl9OmL6 
I have never been mor e disappointed in a company, charging $8 to use your wifi which only works for about 8 apps parhetic 
I love ya but your bringin me down. An hour Late Flight leaving and now we've been sitting in the runway for 20 min üò• #fail 
We should be landing at RIC right now, but haven't even left ATL. Should have picked Delta maybe? 
BETSY is the BESTY! Gettin' stuck at #LAS might not be bad for most..but I want home! #homewardbound #betsy #besty #thankyou 
do we get to pick which @Imaginedragons show? #DestinationDragons 
I can't begin to tell you how slow my plane's wifi is. I can't even pull up an email.  What am i paying $8 for?? 
Yes! How about #DestinationDragons in San Diego?!? 
Hi! I ‚ù§Ô∏è your company and fly all the time. I was wondering if you could please share this link &amp; read! http://t.co/lO6LghPcdU 
this would be an awesome experience #DestinationDragons 
I don't want to be too whiny. We accommodated several passengers whose earlier flight was Cancelled Flightled. Our flight was very long. 
Another delay. Wow 
I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR tickets to the VEGAS... ANYTHING. I love imagine dragons so much!! 
I would love to go to the Atlanta show ‚ô•Ô∏è

LOVE IMAGINE DRAGONS  SO MUCH I EOULD DIE IF I GOT TICKETS 
#delayed again! You're killing me Late Flightly! 
Why do airlines change ticket prices in the middle of the day
#annoyed 
my sinuses had to contend with two painful landings rather than one, and we missed a preregistration window. Beyond frustrated 
how about some sweet promo code to help me visit my family!!!.... Please!!!... Lol 
last 5 flights have all consistently ran behind schedule what's up with that ?? 
Flying with you in about 2 weeks, bringing blankets bc it's freezing!üòú 
turned my non-stop flight between Laguardia/dal into a 1 stop in STL. WTH? I'm thinking some sorta comp is in order? REALLY? 
so for an extra luggage, it cost $75???? 
Promotion also said two free round trip flights. Nope, had to pay $200 extra for chi to Vegas. Bait&amp;switch. 
would love to win tickets and take my son to Imagine Dragons in Provo Saturday night.  Crossed fingers. #DestinationDragons 
was fantastic! That's the best flight service I've ever had. 
Gracias... appreciate that! 
unable to book travel right now on the website or through the app. Help! 
when are you releasing your flights for September? Just found out you fly direct lbb to las! So excited! #tripofalifetime 
three flights with three  check in agents, not enough. #missedflight  back to Jet Blue 
luxury! Only 40 people on this flight. I'm going to get spoiled. 
If a travel advisory is posted for DEN, can I then make changes to my ticket? Anything I need to know before I call? 
Hi! Winter Wx Advisory issued for STL. Snow &amp; Ice &amp; Cold, oh my! Will you issue a travel advisory for that? 
thanks for leaving me hanging here. #destinationdragons flights all fucked up now. No help?! 
thanks for responding. 
your employees at BWI have been amazing! 
hello. my flight is Cancelled Flightled for #destinationdragons and no one at your desk at KCI knows what the fuck is happening!!!!!!!! 
you do a great job of achieving that at most cities, just not at BWI. 
SWEET!!! Glad to hear it. I'll keep you guys in mind next time! 
What does this even mean?  I'm taking about letting elite customers who paid for a seat fill a seat that will go empty anyway. 
Thank you! I can't wait either :) 
is this account even aware of the #destinationdragons contest? The one youre fucking up for me? 
having trouble with Wifi. No matter what I get redirected back to getconnected page even though it says I'm connected. 
it is working on a different device, though. Any help is appreciated. 
that's bull. Once you add a fare to the cart you should be locked in. I made it all the way to PayPal. 
i hope i can take my selfie stick on the plane today! #goingtovegas 
I would love to go to the #DestinationDragons @ImagineDragons show tomorrow in Utah at @VelourLive! I've been trying so hard. 
you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher??? 
 Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. 'Thanks' for the voucher in return for lost bag. 
yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you. 
Repeating this is policy is basically repeating "Fuck you" to your customers. I'll be shopping for a new airline ASAP 
Received awesome phone help from Jim today. Helped me switch around flights booked with points. 
I love you. Air travel doesn't get easier. 
sent DM 
Can you please follow so I can DM? Thx! 
it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!! 
What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :( 
sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it? 
the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5. 
The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad. 
when is the last chance to get #DestinationDragons tickets? I would die of happiness if I won üò≠üôè 
yes, thank you. Just sent DM. 
excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed? 
 Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them. 
i live in the southwest, Imagine Dragons is my favorite band, and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them. it would be amazing + 
#DestinationDragons iD is my favorite band and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them! it would be life changing to see them! 
I have been loyal to Southwest from the beginning but very unhappy about your devaluation.

you will extend if I call the day it expires.why can't it just be extended now?#mightmismybrosgraduation 
so, when your plane doesn't work the luxuries I paid for go away but you keep my money? I need that biz model. 
Maybe it is just a machine... 
is that @MurraySawChuck 
very frustrated. Bought early bird at 6:30am on day tickets were released and got mid-B ticket. Spend $50 for nothing 
already booked my tickets for August 20th-30th!  Can't wait for my vacation! 
 I will dm you now 
delay is understandable but look at the time of the the flight and boarding time. Weird! 
Flight to Nashville was Cancelled Flightled. How do we another flight? I've been trying to call &amp; cannot get a human 
Flying now from JAX to DEN and I paid $8 for wifi that barely is functional.  Couldn't do work if I wanted to.  Never again. 
will you please start offering services out of @triflight and @AshevilleAir to other airports.. Have to drive 3-4 hrs to use u 
No no no. SWA low fares and on-time service is great! But manufactured quirkiness? Mmm, not so much. Signed, -CaptiveAudience 
so the fares I see for flights in fall are the ABSOULUTELY LOWEST they will be? 
If there are any Imagine Dragons tickets left for tomorrow at 
@VelourLive here in Utah I would love to go I am available! :) 
will do. Thank you. 
I will if you can see about moving up my Brother in laws graduation to the 6th.  Thanks.

not sure why we are still here in Dallas.  Plane has been at gate for 30 min.  No update at all.  Flight 1140, poor service. 
Well plane arrived pretty much on time and it's 68 degrees on the ground in Texas. Not much to complain about. 
I have a voucher w swa that expires 4/10. An extension would be a lot of luv 
every other city on your nationwide sale has fabulous fares. Why nothing from Buffalo? except for 2 cities?

check the head of the plane, there has been dynamite placed onto it

I will be calling someone on Monday in customer relations. Very disappointed in how I was treated by customer service! 
extremely frustrating travel experience in Denver! Instead of landing in SEA on Saturday, now it's Monday afternoon!

really shouldn't offer sweeps if your link isn't going to work! B http://t.co/nOfG0TQHYN 
flying by myself is getting old 
I changed my flight through St. Louis. Thanks for the reply though! 
yes please 
want go from New Orleans houston see my dad at md anderson can you help me out 
expect no help from -&gt;@SouthwestAir &lt;-.  Our flt was canx at the last minute for "weather."  We flew home on weatherless @united. 
Thank you SWA and Shannon G. @LASairport (C22) for being a miracle worker! #awesome 
beautiful view flying into San Jose, CA this evening http://t.co/SxVaGbRTlI 
retiring with my hubby and it's our 25th wedding anniversary this year! Companion pass please!! 
 how do you get one? 
I have a child traveling cross country...she's 11 will be turning 12 in march...and (cont) http://t.co/Enh1keUUTd 
no you are not, you just care about mighty dollar. 
Flight 3267 (N659SW) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @MitchellAirport http://t.co/LJ2YdKoR8q 
please start flying to Huntsville so I never have to fly American Airlines again 
it's ok! Southwest is still the best airline around! Just hate when baggage room runs out.. My now checked bag has headphones! 
very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies. 
first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan. 
no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$! 
but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines. 
we're pulling off the runway now! Making new friends with seat mates. Thanks for the response CB. 
why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information 
how long does it take for my Rapid Rewards points to be credited to my account? 
after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy üò£ 
Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM. 
Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust. 
I'm flying out of CUN tomorrow To DEN - can I change my flight due to the travel advisory?? 
For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight? 
@MegElizabeth631 how you like the #redcarpet treatment 
especially if it's your mom! #IChangedYourDiaper 
how do I get a companion pass 
i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home. 
been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me. 
thank you!! 
I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country. 
Free TV watching Daytona 500! #Boss http://t.co/SbGBN7oUXy 
A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail. 
I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help? 
it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago 
Winter Weather for Denver extended for tomorrow by chance? Even to Late Flightr in the day would be super helpful. 
luv my companion pass! 
@fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night. 
yes, please #companionpass 
All good... beers and #oscars2015 ar #DIA 
thank you : 8UXZJ2
Paid for early bird and sat in back 
kudos to the crew of flight 1050 to GRR for making a very special memory for a sweet young passenger, and her Momma. Well done 
may I have my Companion pass please. 
I know that not everybody on flight can be 1st time flying. But in case it is people in front deplane 1st not from the back?!? 
me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal? 
Thanks for helping my mom after @allegiantair wouldn't let her get on her plane in Orlando! You're the best! #customerservice 
yeah, 7am flight tomorrow, going to add 60-90 min extra because of the roads / snow 
waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink üòï 
glad you appreciate it, it‚Äôll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service 
thanks! Very excited to see it :D 
would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time. 
  A whole family, with a special Olympic athlete here, and you can't even call them? 617-653-3040 
is not being responding to the @SpecialOlympics athletes.  #notcool #Southwest 
crew of WN3946 SAN-SFO was brilliant! Rita was hilarious. I know I've been down on you before, but this was a great flight 
It was never really "lost" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren't sure what flight but I have it - TY! 
what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over. 
apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me. 
TY for your consideration! 
now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted 
Thx for the follow up. Just sent DM 
luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business. 
nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass. 
is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys üíîüò™ 
broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it's not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now. 
@jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking 
you're right, I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night. 
Just reading your boarding policy, we're a group of 8 travellers with kids ranging from 3-10, is it possible to sit together? 
flight Cancelled Flightled. new flight 7 hours Late Flightr. will sleep in airport tonight. and cant even give me an A Boarding Group seat. thx 
 kudos to your rep "Patricia" at gate B11 this Sunday morning at #Chicago #Midway #MDW,‚Ä¶ http://t.co/MmCWkqp2gy 
you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016 
You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.) 
I am in, let's do this! 
needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson 
loved it! 
Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail

How do I get a companion pass??? Thanks,  Lin S 
loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable. 
@nelsjeff, 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn't sell out. 
customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable 
does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights? 
Are there discounts every tuesday cause Im leaving fron Birmingham Airport to San fran Next week in march sometime

@coachGS what's even better is the price changed in the 2 minutes since I talked to the lady and they still honored the cheap1 
@matthewebel And this is why I love flying Southwest. Excellent service, and you don't take yourselves too seriously! 
@LukeWyckoff: her name is Jane and she wanted was a call. 617-653-3040 
we checked in right at 24hr mark. Boarding C group with kids ages 6&amp;8 dnt want to be split. What sld we do? 
: thanks.are flights operating now or Cancelled Flightled? 
I hope this isn't a real life scene out of the movie 'Flight' ..... 
open seating is like an open marriage, there's so much love for strangers! 
thank you for great customer service. Trying to make it to San Antonio and your staff and alerts have been helpful. Boo ice! 
I did. Still haven't heard a thing. 
Just got companion pass and trying to add companion flgt but get purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS. Help! 
I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!! 
yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage. 
Glad to know I'll be flying the luv airline tomorrow ;) 
Wasn't able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2 
I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours. 
my friends from Boston stuck in Denver. Her name Jane. @RnCahill  Please contact her. 
Can my wife's RR points be transferred to my RR account? 
res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change @ counter #fail 
I never got an email confirmation for my ticket, but the credit card was charged.  Phone wait time is crazy. Is there a chat? 
I would appreciate that.  Thank you. 
they arrived Late Flight but pilots got us to DIA on time. #impressive #outstanding #greatservice #allgood 
yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight. 
 thanks for adding passbook ability! Hopefully we can do group passbook tickets in the future somehow. 
Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0 
i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag. 
My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed. 
it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :) 
when can we expect customer service in Dallas to be available 
Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight? 
Awesome. Thanks! You guys rock! 
need assistance getting an extension on a flight that has expired. 
it's not disappointment, it's a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it's becoming a problem that's pushing 
a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it's being abused @ every airport... 
easy fix, let the business select actually board 1st, then board the pre-boards... 
nice touch on the passbook integration! 
Thanks, Lindsey. Any idea when I'll get there?! Stuck in Denver and told to "listen to the intercom better". 
 how many others didn't know you are stopping non stop flights to ATL and from to Hartford Ct as of April ? 
Thanks. I did go through these motions shortly after my flight yesterday. I wonder how quickly flight attendants are notified. 
I regret not flying you this morning @VirginAmerica doesn't support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness 
My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me. 
That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time. 
Thanks for the quick reply!  I travel a lot...but not that much, lol. 
understand the weather, these kids need to get home! Nice kids doing volunteer work from a RI high school, please help 
When will the flight resume? I don's see it in the open schedule. :/ 
Got help from a nice lady on the phone in Georgia.  Thank you! 
delayed twice now Cancelled Flighted...sent complaint email, yet no response.  Need an explanation pls. #notsatisfied #smh #unhappy 
why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition 
Completely understand Act of God weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightlation, but 4 days without reimbursement of any kind is #unacceptable 
yeah they're somewhere. Hopefully getting them back today. Just frustrated tweeting. 
 your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha 
another great trip! LAX 823 - LAS 3075-  BNA. Thanks so much!!! 
Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back? 
this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. http://t.co/SbA0ARicyq 
A+ to the Safety Dos and Don'ts Announcer. Flight 651 from Midway (MDW) to Pittsburgh (PIT)! 
@HDsportsguy yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow. 
my ticket was booked 1/27 to CUN. Does the arrival time reflect that CUN is now on EST time? 
love the passbook update. Used it the day after it was released. Finally!! Thank you! 
hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning #grateful #businesstrip 
could you please tell me if there is a way to add a RR# to a flight that already took place? 
pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck? 
if only you could control the weather in Las Vegas üòâ 
I'll stick with flying for free any where that Southwest goes; my son works for this wonderful company and Moms fly free. 
Thanks, you guys are the best 
 Your Terry is our hero.  Got my husband back thru security to retrieve his cellphone in Austin. Terry (#85832) You Rock! 
Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock! 
weren't too "sincere" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home.. 
Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice. 
 Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock! 
I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them? 
done. Sorry, I thought I was already. 
how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty 
I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans 
@fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel 
just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. Class act. I appreciate that! 
will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?! 
, please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm????? 
is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions 
but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!? 
Awesome staff at the  check in desk! They had a paper airplane race for a SW gift card to keep ppl entertained during delays 
thanks!! 
why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149 
Just go ahead and start the scavenger hunt after 5 pm today when work is over ;) #DestinationDragons

Is it possible to add companion to only the 2nd leg of a trip? 
10+ people pre boarded
Only 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding 
how do get priority seating after you already paid for the flight 
 I sent a email to customer relations and I will be calling tomorrow. 
is it possible to add travel arranged by my employer to my upcoming travel? I can retrieve a reservation, but that's it. 
LUV! your new Luv Television Commercials. Traveled on your airline last year return trip from NYC...#feltthelove 
grrrrrr I need a flight there first! Maybe for my bday next month... 
really easy for locals to get down to the strip. book. 
right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows? 
Your crew on 3138 is doing a great job of keeping everyone informed during the delays #givethemraises 
#Vegas I was there 5 days ago. Miss the  Warm Weather 
that was supposed to say "boo" not book. booo.

still there? I was posted up in Downtown waiting for y'all. On my way!

What can we do to bring you back to Jackson, MS?! We miss you terribly around here. These other airlines are horrible!! 
ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury.

got to the strip that fast before. Stoked for special @Imaginedragons show tonight! Thx again @SouthwestAir! http://t.co/ToPqmVqnJp 
thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really? 
it's not fun having a delay from Nashville to Las Vegas, but the crew at the gate C9 desk has been AWESOME! #patience #luvswa 
Big kudos to your staff today at Dallas Love Field for lifting everyone's spirits today with all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations 
Travel agent Darrel here at Love Field hosting a paper airplane contest to entertain all the children was so awesome to see!

Twitter cust svc rule 1 Dont say IF we fell short. I just told u u did! #2 If u cant solve problem don't say anything at all! 
here is my conf #F8NEQM. My flight was delayed for 3 hours while my friend waited for me on her bday. Please follow up. 
has become like every other airline #crooked I can't believe they are taking over $500 #shouldwearmasks #shocked 
in flight wifi + @TMobile wifi calling makes for the best combination. Who doesn't love texting 40,000 feet in the air :D 
Do you know the reason flight #336 from Dallas to Midland was diverted to Lubbock? Was suppose to be direct to Midland. 
your welcome. It was the thoughts of nearly the entire plane. 
reference #: 261093929756 
won't let me send a DM because they don't follow me.. #lovedflyingwiththem #notanymore #wrong #badpolicy 
What an awesome flight Dallas 2 NY. Virgin America refused bc of my child's peanut allergy but u guys didn't. Thanks! üëçüòä 
should offer cdn border towns incentive to fly since exchange rates are #hurt. #customerappreciation #gaincustomers #keepem2 
The Fact That U See Black History Month 12 Months A Year Is Honorable! We WILL BE An Economic Base For Corp. Like U In Future! 
üëèüëèüëè on that Late Flightst ad. Makes me happy to be flying you in a few days. #BETHonors 
we can let #bags flutter because we charge travelers that had to change dates #fullprice and we don't let them travel 
had a great flight to and from Cabo last week with my family #smoothflight #frequentflyer 
Please lower my plane flight by like $100 bucks!! Thanks~ #FloridaVacation 
making me miss #TheBachelor right now #wah 
When will your phone agents be able to give the correct departure times for CUN? When can we checkin online for international? 
forget wedding fairs. How about discounts for nonprofits? We donate part of our worth every single day 
wifi stays connected about the lifetime of a higgs boson 
you should have assigned seating, because now my cousin &amp; I probably can't sit together on our flight tomorrow.. Thanks. 
way to fuck up and lose @c_istudios bags. My husband has no warm clothes and no equipment. #youdidit #notcool 
you need to redeem yourself. I lost respect for you tonight #lostbags #filmjobnoequipment 
I love this airline so much! Thanks so much! The service is great! The snacks are amazing! Everything is outstanding thanks!! 
Looking forward to flying once again with #SWA on Friday! The #LUV airline. #DTW #MDW #TUS 
hey remember that time you lost my husbands bags? I do.

Hello SWA, Who is your POC for partnerships with nonprofit organizations in BWI area? 
cool shot of the moon and one of your fleet http://t.co/kl9BAiMES6 
quick question - i bought wifi for my phone, do I have to buy it again on my tablet? I have 9 hours left on my trip 
darn! I bought it on the wrong device! No way to switch I'm sure? 
it's a new day and a new chance for you to do the right thing it's never too Late Flight to be honest. 
up at 4AM and arrive to find it already Cancelled Flighted. No options so miss my meeting. You might "know" but don't show it. 
After multiple attempts, I was finally able to submit them Late Flight last night. 
customer service at FLL, BWI,and PIT have been terrible.no one knows where his bags are.his is on a job with no clothes &amp; gear 
I would like to ask that his bags be picked up at PIT &amp; taken to his hotel by the airport. Will someone contact me 
loving the new planes and the lighting, only wish windows were larger. http://t.co/h44uJ63CJG 
three hour flight to Orlando and no wifi? Uncool. #firstworldproblems 
customer service you shouldn't use those words wasted my time and took my money #BadBussiness #Theft http://t.co/63zaQ2lt8f 
it's just the principle - it's hard to get mugged &amp; not be upset you took my money &amp; didn't give me anything #wrongiswrong 
give us some more clever advertising about #bagsflyfree is that because #badpolicy allows you to #cheatcustomers 
i have asked Lindsey to call me instead of DM like a schoolgirl but so far no call   Getting tired of typing little notes 
can anyone help me upgrade to buisness select !? Cant seem to get hail of the right area at all .. I know you guys are good 
I was not the one traveling. I was asking for my sister who was waiting on my nephew in Midland...flight eventually landed 
I luv y'all but please stop overheating your planes. Second flight in a row that feels like a sauna. 
when and why was flight 4471 from MSP Cancelled Flighted this AM? 
- We left iPad in a seat pocket.  Filed lost item report. Received it exactly 1 week Late Flightr.  Is that a record?  #unbelievable 
the flight isn't that empty.... Is this rude or not? http://t.co/4RL0p5JChB 
weather where? And at what time Cancelled Flighted? No I can't because meeting was today. 
no need, I know the status, you Cancelled Flightled instead of delaying the flight. 
how do you know? @SouthwestAir 
my bday was yesterday and my girl gave birth to my first born and I couldn't get a courtesy flight change from Lynn... THANKS! 
can you tell me why you Cancelled Flightled the flight vs delay 
Any ETD for SWA1004 from PHL? Appears delayed but no info available at gate. 
sent 
I urgently need two receipts sent but CS is closed. Can you help? 
I "heart" Southwest but those commercials aimed to satisfy a nano-smattering of travelers to few destinations. 
bumped me to preboard on both flights (because I'm fat?) Whatever the reason, thanks! 
Thanks to your team for dealing with Flight 1700 to Houston. 
  I hate evolved seating. knees in the seat pocket http://t.co/forNpF69Ky 
Thank you for the tip! 
why is customer relations still not open....in Texas?! 
would be great if I atleast was next to my husband who is flying in the same reservation 
Wife's RR pts expired a few days ago, were planning on Flight Booking Problems trip today. Anything you can do for us? On a tight budget... 
...was only less than 3500pts, but it helped. Had PartnerRewards incoming, but not fast enough to keep pts from expiring. 
25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt  every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees 
I called the 800 # and the rep there was pleasant but less than helpful! Told me I was SOL. Train them for consistent #CX! 
Thanks for the text, but not exactly timely 8). Data throughout issues today maybe? http://t.co/aaU9MKA6Zy 
#stepup #makeitright re you best? Or just money hungry? #wewillsee 
why was Southwest only airline to Cancelled Flight all flights from Charleston? Was 7:50pm flight Cancelled Flightation really weather reLate Flightd? 
has the smoooothest flight attendants. #SouthwestSmoothie http://t.co/Vr9k180LaI 
Thank you for taking good care of people with ALS! http://t.co/m1yyWAFkFI @KevinSwan_ @ALSTDI @A_Life_Story_ 
@PHLAirport Will Flight 2155 that arrives at E11 be a penguin plane? 
thanks to Ella-Mae at LAS counter for going above and beyond to help us get back to ABQ after our flight was Cancelled Flightled! 
is the best airline hands down. Amazing customer service, bags free and affordable flights. #happycamper 
An Oscar-worthy entrance into LA. http://t.co/10tmtHVFDC 
Tried for VIP Live in The Vineyard but yr site went down, by the time I got in 2 redeem pts those packages gone. 
Why, when I booked via phone after calling the A List preferred #, didn't my KTA get added to the ticket??? Must I use web? 
Switching planes due to mechanical problems.  How does reboarding work? Was A49, now at end of long line.  Stuck in middle? 
is there a resource to check delays/Cancelled Flightlations out of Love Field? Flying out tomorrow am and stressed about weather! ‚ùÑÔ∏è 
@intuit @jhamilton2007 4 moms, 4 careers, 1 day trip to LA. #intuitlife #leanin http://t.co/2qJbCv5jzq" #southwestairlines 
Is there a way to receive a refund on a trip that was Cancelled Flight online instead of calling? Your phone lines are super busy. 
ok thank you  i hope  so too 
#VIPLiveintheVieyard - first time we tried to redeem pts for *anything*, it really did not go well. #disappointed 
is America's largest airline by passengers carried! Wonder if this is b/c they have a 'Customer Service Bible' #ANAmarketers 
I have used you guys for most my travels, but this last experience I will never use southwest again! #worstcustomerservice 
Customer Centricity is knowing people #ANAMarketers 
traditionally used sledge hammer - low $ taking share from driving | now scalpel approach through data science  #ANAmarketers 
Thank you! 
NOR @SpiritAirlines fly to Toronto?!?!? You're killing me smalls....... 
Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful. 
Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online? 
hey southwest! Help me find a flight from Nashville - Washington DC or Raleigh for under $150 on March 15 please! 
Airline trouble &amp; not getting satisfactory customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate resolutions for You! 
INSANE traffic in LA. Trying to call you all to re schedule flight but been on phone for 20 minutes and nothing. 
LA always has traffic, but this is INSANE. I can't be the only one with this issue on flight 1625 
strives to be 'Customer Centric' in everything they do - communications, advertising, customer journey, etc. #ANAmarketers 
Hey, friends. When I phone the A-list number your IVR hangs up on me. Multiple times. Not sure how to proceed? 
Thanks! Sent a DM to you. Let me know if oyu need any additional information. 
flight 1614 FLL to ATL. My wife traveling with infant. Line to check baggage 200 people long due to your computer system crash 
my wife and 9 month old might miss flight and next direct is 210 pm. Mother in law been on hold with customer support for 30 
mins and no answer. My wife and baby need to get on that flight. She arrived 2 hrs prior. Please help. Venetia Crook 
and Carol Thrower are passengers. Fort Lauderdale airport. 
hey I'm flying from Tampa to Denver today and I want to know if there will be tv's in the seats like @JetBlue 
how come I'm not getting my points after I buy from the rapid reward shopping site? 
Supposed to take off almost 2 hours ago....#vacationfail #frozenwater? #gettingimpatient #theycouldatleastofferfreebooze 
I booked a flight on my phone and then never got a confirmation email. How would I go about getting that? 
and thx for not responding 
That was Chantilly, Paris, France. 
 on hold with customer service; you may be quicker.  I rebooked trip for a lower fare.  Where did the difference in $ go? 
frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is.... 
live in Atlanta but cant enroll in your Atlanta companion promotion. Error every time. Can you help? Also sent email. Thanks! 
unfortunately I don't even have that. My phone died before o had a chance to grab it. It was from OMA to SAN from 3/27-4/2 
can you please make sense of the companion promo? How to we set it up? 
Barzegar charges tourists 700 euros [!] a night for their stay in the tent village he runs. http://t.co/igSVzvrbbN 
unfortunately once the call was answered service was horrid. SWA was the role-model of finger pointing &amp; excuses #DISAPPOINTED 
SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays. 
your website has now reverted my 1st flight to only a 5-minute delay. But it's changed, so is that reliable information? 
if you're going to charge for wifi, do us all a solid and make sure it doesn't take the length of the flight to open a page 
do you know that your lost baggage portal http://t.co/hUcLXluV5h doesn't work on mobile? It's a 404 http://t.co/O4ZR27Qpcr 
u have a lot of pissed off hungry tired people stuck at midway 4 over 2 hours after scheduled departure. This is inexcusable 
due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first 
flight to Atlanta getting Cancelled Flightled and then had to re schedule on the phone for over 1.5 hours with a rep this bumping us 
from groupA to group C. We have never got to sit next to each other on any south west flight not even on our honey moon 
where your airline people screwed up our boarding passes on the way back from puerto Vallarta. This is horrible and we are 
freezing in the plane 
Rapid Rewards program sold me short. #Lasttweetaboutthis but still #disappointed. 
nothing you can do to help us restore some barely-expired #RapidRewards points? 
Thx for your quick response and action! bf will make good use of the voucher #satisfied #happycustomer 
was on flight 2373 from CHI-BUF last night, almost 2 hour delay cuz someone got on the plane without a pass - sounds safe. 1/2 
then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE, because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal 
Any idea when the winter advisory will be posted for ATL for tomorrow (2/25)?? I'd rather get to PHL tonight. 
I think I get a faster response on Twitter than I do when I call...what's up with that? 
done 
Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch 
need to learn how to treat people with respect and just a little dignity. #FAIL 
yes, very much so! I was looking forward to using your airlines for future flights but never again. 
3rd time flying southwest in two years. Have another trip back to mx on October. 
horrible experience, passenger of size was 1/3 in my seat, offered $50 voucher for this by Christine C http://t.co/1xzrK66wVQ 
have to follow me back so that I can DM @SouthwestAir 
I have a 5:30 flight out of Birmingham tomorrow night. Can I reschedule it for an earlier flight because of the expected snow? 
@SMiles1307 over two hours now.  Ugh we should all get vouchers this is inexcusable ESP after a pre flight check that was ok. 
I was told by customer service that only customer relations can extend the expiration date of my unused travel funds. 
thanks for the apology. Unfortunately i have had one too many bad experiences and will no longer be flying with southwest. 
had to let us off the plane bc the toilets done even work! There goes my family vacay to playa del Carmen, Mexico! #neveragain

great now we are all de boarding perfectly plane is shot. Fml. Plans are screwed. Thanks for nothing @SouthwestAir 
Yo, I'm trying to make a change to a reservation but whenever I select the flight it says, "Unable to price". Please help! 
My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online? 
trying to change my reservation, been on hold for 45 minutes, and can't do it online-was directed to call. Help? 
oh and now your company has caused us to lose an entire day of our vacation in Cancun. De Boarded waiting for another plane 
and now our arrival is delayed nearly 5hours. Yeah an entire day in an airport is not my idea of a stress less vacation #fail 
are people in an exit row still supposed to give their verbal approvals? I was never asked on the flight I'm on... 
"Airport snow removal method #22.."
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/7poFSXOjSY 
my flight at BWI is delayed and I will miss my flight in Denver, is there a way to find out if they will hold the plane? 
your phone service sucks 
its flight #218 of that matters to you all. Hell next we all won't get our luggage properly transferred #facepalm #smh 
I agree! RT @9NEWS: One airline is the fly-away favorite at DIA  #9NEWSBusiness http://t.co/o3WlaInImY 
@heavenlychc9 I'd at least enjoy a free cocktail...or two. 
what is the status of the bag check area at FFL? 
tv stream means I get to spend my flight watching 1999 and 2011 Women's World Cup Finals. #throwback #bestflightever 
I'm so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn't help! 
went to purchase a flight that I began processing not even 4 minutes earlier and the points had gone up - any help? 
round-trip tickets just arrived for our auction at the Post-Masters Invitational! Thanks Southwest! http://t.co/mRfBjtePef 
Thanks so much! 
 THANK YOU for your awesome flights. Sweetheart got screwed on @FlyFrontier, managed to scramble and get a SW plane today. !!! 
I'm following now 
have u seen any of the messages the past hour ? 
20 minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous...... 
sent! 
 appreciate y'all getting the gate issue figured GRR. Plenty open gates, yet we sit and wait on tarmac 
sure, please follow me so I can do so? 
thx but I'll be expecting a credit for this leg. 
 got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience. 
 I USED to always fly Southwest. 
they were moved to the 210pm flight #4649. Main concern now is luggage arriving with them. They were told that SW was having 
oh, is it only in Atlanta? 
belt issues. Been a rough day for them. Worst part is traveling with 9 month old and having to wait outside in 85 degree 
weather bc of system outage. Hopefully everything goes smoothly now. Thank you for follow up 
oh look you just delayed our flight an additional half hour now arriving at 6 officially five hours after planned. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò§üò§üò§ 
Just DMed you my confirmation number. 
Do you promise to not unfollow me? üòâ 
has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife, traveling alone w/our 2 young kids.  never again. 
I managed to get sorted out over the phone. Good luck dealing with the snow in Texas! 
she needs a wheelchair at the gate for sure. What options does she have? 
never mind, I moved my flight to tomorrow. Thanks for the help! 
did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24 
can you have someone call me back? I have been on hold two times today for over 20 min and still haven't gotten through 
 thanks Southwest for saving our trip. my sweetheart isn't going to miss seeing #AltonBrownLive thanks to y'all! #SOhappy 
Logically you would think you check all that before you have people board. I could've drove home in the time I've been waiting 
can take u to Midway-Chicago March 8th-April 6th. Can't make it then? @AmericanAir can get u to @fly2ohare year round. #FlyPBI 
can y'all develop Ding for a chrome/Firefox browser extension? That would be swell

my flight was delayed 4 hrs. I'm 5 months pregnant &amp; supposed to be caring for my mom whose in surgery now. Very upset. 
my wife had been in group A in prev. flight but got bumped for some reason.  Alone with two kids. At least put her in group A 
your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix. 
still no update text #2053 &amp; still no response to email fr1/5/2015 SR #256746438028. Feel like yr losing customer service/care 
Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!! 
I'm teaching new #travelers how to research, #budget &amp; #save for a trip today! http://t.co/Qll48r57ep 
Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can't get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!!
