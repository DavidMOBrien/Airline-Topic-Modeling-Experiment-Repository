Book out of town with fares from $59/way (+restr). http://t.co/xRdTOV7nl8 http://t.co/4Y78byAckc‚Äù @JenniferDawnPro 
Flying LAX to SFO and after looking at the awesome movie lineup I actually wish I was on a long haul. 
was wondering if you guys recieved my dm and we're able to potentially respond asap 
still waiting to see  @Starryeyes_Dev_  üòû 
morning. If I have a question regarding elevate points &amp; flights can I DM you? 
just got on the 1pm in Newark home to LA. Your folks at EWR are incredible #letsgohome 
Are there any sign up bonuses to enroll in Elevate? 
my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can't because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either üò° 
my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. Any update on how long of a delay? 
mood lighting on pointüôå Reclining my seat, kickin up my feetüí§ 
really wish you'd fly out of #Fargo @fargoairport those fares are amazings 
Can you give me Silver Status for 12 months? 
thanks! Y'all have some of the best customer service left in the industry. 
you guys are perfect as always! &lt;3 #WeRVirgin 
Any way to change from Main Cabin to Main Cabin Select (on same flight) without paying a change fee penalty? 
so loyal that I'm driving to #NYC from #PA, to fly Virgin,  since you cut #Philly flights ;) 
Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)‚Ä¶tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees. 
Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer? 
As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers. 
Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again! 
should use this in their next airline commercial lol :: http://t.co/pXEXIlSjBs 
Dear Virgin customer, while you're stranded in SF for 3 days &amp; $1000cost- we'll do the very least we can to accommodate you! 
While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck! 
not only was it great, but you return my calls the day after. Couldn't ask for more. #myVXexperience 
started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me. 
how come ABC is the only one of the network channels you don't have? 
wifi AND better seating. 
Are there any plans for a short haul airline in Europe? Would defiantly fly with you guys :) 
Dad on Segway is the best part of this whole infographic!

I'm sure a lot of your 747 and 777 JFK-LHR flights go a lot faster than 513mph with a strong tailwind. 
That's classy. 
does Virgin America fly direct from Seattle to NYC or Boston? 
I am all about the in flight artisanal cheese and wine pairing. 
I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I've been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes.......... 
Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1) 
All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row! 
Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag. 
Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well?

can you please have flights in  SJC ? I have no choice but to fly Southwest to Vegas üò©üò≠ 
@TTINAC11 I DM you 
shame on VA for making people spend money in stranded cities when other airlines are landing at JFK! Who will reimburse me? 
- too many apologies! You r the worse airlines! Don't even respond to your cudtomers 
Thank you for the follow 
I'd love to know what your policy is for damaged luggage. 
 I applied over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard back and I'm flying this week #disappointed 
congrats, you just got all my business from EWR to SFO/LAX. Fuck you @united fl1289 SFO/EWR was the clincher...

- Your site seems a little wonked right now. May want to have a look. Tried on two browsers. No CSS? http://t.co/8qsQMM7KF2 
is the website down? 
why don't any of the pairings include red wine?! Only white is offered :( #redwineisbetter 
our flight into lga was Cancelled Flighted. We're stuck in Dallas. I called to reschedule, told I could get a flight for today...(1/2) 
got a flight (we were told) for 4:50 today..,checked my email and its for 4;50 TOMORROW. This is unacceptable. 
I rang, but there is a wait for 35 minutes!! I can book the same ticket through a vendor, fix your site 
How do I reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flights online? The change button is greyed out! 
having problems Flight Booking Problems on the web site. keeps giving me an error and to contact by phone.  phone is 30 minute wait. 
my drivers license is expired by a little over a month. Can I fly Friday morning using my expired license? 
Is flight 0769 out of LGA to DFW on time? 
 - Is Flight 713 from Love Field to SFO definitely Cancelled Flightled for Monday, February 23? 
is your website ever coming back online? 
thank you for checking in. tickets are purchased and customer is happy ;-) 
is there special assistance if I travel alone w/2 kids and 1 infant? Priority boarding? 
does that mean you don't have a policy for destroyed luggage? 
I don't understand why you need a DM to give me an answer on if you have a damaged luggage policy. 
#flight home to #dc #sunset #globe in' #backtowinter back to #work! #refreshed http://t.co/VX9vBCTdLf 
have it together!!! You're welcome! RT @VirginAmerica: @jessicajaymes You're so welcome. 
question: is it not possible to book a seat for an infant under 2? It's not giving me the option but we want a seat for him. 
I paid the premium to fly you across the country, you Cancelled Flight my flight and offer no check fee or upgrade love? Sad face :( 
you have amazing staff &amp; super helpful as I just ran the @WaltDisneyWorld #PrincessHalf they have spoiled me with comfort!!! 
please provide status for flight 769.  I cant imagine it's on time as the Web indicates  dude to weather here and/or Dallas 
Can you find us a flt out of LAX that is sooner than midnight on Monday? That would be great customer service üòÉ 
best customer service rep in the world! #irmafromDallas takes the cake!!! 
You'd think paying an extra $100 bucks RT for luggage might afford you hiring an extra hand at @sfo #lame 
why can't we book seats on your flights when we buy them or even during check in? Creates so much anxiety! #frustrated 
always!!! Xoxo 
@reallytallchris dropped a track on you... https://t.co/zv2pt6TRK9 
you ROCK for making it so I can watch #Oscars on my flight!! #redcarpet #oscars #oscars2015 
I need to register a service dog for a first class ticket from SFO &gt; Dulles. The phone queue is an hour or longer. Pls advise 
Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless 
@ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you! 
has flight number 276 from SFO to Cabo San Lucas arrived yet? 
@FiDiFamilies us too! Terrible airline! Just gave us a hotel hotline number and said sorry 
you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check. 
is flight 882 Cancelled Flightled and what do I do if it is? 
How can I watch the #Oscars2015 on my JFK-&gt;SFO flight? 
completely awesome experience last month BOS-LAS nonstop. Thanks for such an awesome flight and depart time. #VAbeatsJblue 
i need to change my flight thats scheduled in 9 hours and 120 min wait time on phone. Im calling intern. Help!! 
Do you provide complimentary upgrades to first class, if there are available seats? 
you have the absolute best team and customer service ever.  Every time I fly with you I'm delighted.  Thank you! 
thanks to your outstanding NYC-JFK crew who moved mountains to get me home to San Francisco tonight! 
I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370 
And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks, what is the problem? 
Use another browser! 2015 &amp; a brand with a reputation built on tech response doesn't have a cross-browser compatible website? 
Love the team running Gate E9 at LAS tonight. Waited for a delayed flight, and they kept things entertaining 
your beautiful front-end design is down right now; but it was cool to still book my ticket b/c all your back-end was secure. 
and again! Another rep kicked butt! Naelah represents your team so beautifully!! Thank you!!! 
is the best airline I have flown on.Easy to change your reservation,helpful representatives &amp; a comfortable flying experience 
should I be concerned that I am about to fly on a plane that needs to be delayed due to a "tech stop"? 
come back to #PHL already. We need you to take us out of this horrible cold. #pleasecomeback http://t.co/gLXFwP6nQH

What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation. 
- Let 2 scanned in passengers leave the plane than told someone to remove their bag from 1st class bin? #uncomfortable 
I can't check in or add a bag. Your website isn't working. I've tried both desktop and mobile http://t.co/AvyqdMpi1Y 
Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn't a great user experience.  Time for another redesign. 
why is flight 345 redirected? 
just landed in LAX, an hour after I should of been here. Your no Late Flight bag check is not business travel friendly #nomorevirgin 
I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday . 
hi, i did not get points on my elevate account for my most recent flight, how do i add the flight and points to my account?

Why is the site down?  When will it be back up?

awesome. I flew yall Sat morning. Any way we can correct my bill ? 
not worried, it's been a great ride in a new plane with great crew. All airlines should be like this. 
your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt 
hi I just booked a flight but need to add baggage, how can I do this? 
I emailed your customer service team. Let me know if you need the tracking number. 
Need to change reservation. Have Virgin credit card. Do I need to modify on phone to waive change fee? Or can I do online? 
everything was fine until you lost my bag

seriously would pay $30 a flight for seats that didn't have this playing.
it's really the only bad thing about flying VA 
and it's a really big bad thing about it 
it's really aggressive to blast obnoxious "entertainment" in your guests' faces &amp; they have little recourse 
I didn't today... Must mean I need to take another trip! 
plus you've added commercials to the experience... tacky.
