Thanks! Her flight leaves at 2 but she's arriving to the airport early. Wedding is in VT in Sept. Grateful you fly to BTV!! :) 
No worries. Delay was minor and dealt with nicely. It was captain of flight 2324 by the way. 
really caring?? 
sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn't be nicer 
A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.

busy due to storm but customer service should always be on point. More so now than ever #getittogether 
my request has nothing to do with rescheduling. But customer service has such a bad attitude today. #badservice 
@EllaHenderson omg!  Wish I had a flight today!  Haha there's always next time!  Have fun at #LFT5 
Hopefully next time! Can I send you my future itineraries so the next one can be planned when I'm there? üòÇüòÇ

well lucky I only fly JB..I guess I would be even more squished on any other airline üòû 
Got flight reschedule to flight form PIT to FLL and our flight had mechanical problems so we were delayed an hour Missed my connect 
I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact. 
Ok great thanks! I had a great flight, FYI. I'm excited to fly again. I just was frustrated I was not able to check in. 
should i continue? 
@EllaHenderson Ah! Wish I was there! Good luck! 
why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours. This is insane. Every other flight has made it to NYC. 
unfortunately no, but hoping I can catch one sometime in the near future!

they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting 
Seems very likely. 
already spent $300 to stay at hotel last night due to you guys rescheduling my flight. Since my Cancelled Flightation I've spent almost $500 
and they are telling me I got to get another hotel and food...so spend more money because you guys made me miss my connection 
I did...#FlyFi worked well and was free aboard this flight 
thanks!! Great service in #T5 already! #lovejetBlue 
tough choices but I did all simultaneously! As a business traveler, best experience in a long time. #wishmyflightwaslonger #what

hard to tell, but was told wifi only worked for one side of the plane. 
2:55 tomorrow from RIC to BOS. Looking good or am I better rescheduling?

I will. I love flying with you all. Great service. 
Is there something going on with your alerts? Flight's been delayed several times for my parents and i'm not receiving any alerts. 
i'm getting info from the website, but needing to check it and the alerts would be much more beneficial. 
heard about the charge for 1st bag and tighter seats - no need to be a loyal JB customer anymore! 
@KyleJudah I just spoke to the baggage claim center and they gave me travel credit but will not be responsible for the cost of a 
@KyleJudah new stroller. The travel credit doesn't help cover the cost of a new stroller. Your crew ruined it and therefore should 
@KyleJudah be responsible for replacing it 
Great thanks 
I'll give u a chance but I don't think I'll fall for it #backtodelta 
Thank you for the service credit. And to @PamGrout for positive thoughts.

I would drive 2 1/2 hours to jfk to board JetBlue to Vegas instead of closer Hartford airport. Cramming more seats on plane.NO MORE

tell your employees that! 
well, now saying our flight is going to be Cancelled Flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier, we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2 
that's not an option for us. So how can we help each other fix this? I would've made the change earlier if given accurate info. 
yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves.

flight was Cancelled Flighted. Do I need to file a claim for the $50 credit I'm entitled to per yr bill of rights, or will it just be issued?

I've had no shampoo, no winter coat no deodorant no flatiron and the rest if my stuff since sat 
right now completely pissed off 
offered to pay for tix at the airport BC we were never told that our reservation didn't go through. Was told I could pay $2275 pp. 
supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided! 
I have the emails that they are on their way 
I get Sunday due to weather and ok Monday they're busy but this is crazy 
I don't know- no one would tell me where they were coming from - I would guess so as that's where we had all the changes to flights

it was at JFK airport right now 
it's been a while since I've angry tweeted an airline. Apparently you read my mind before I could bitch. Thank you for the credit. 
What about if I booked it through Orbitz? My email is correct, but there's a middle party.

disappointed that my flight back to boston from PR was Cancelled Flightled,rebooked 4 the next day,delayed that one too, and no compensation 
I understand but everyone said different things and there was a flight out Late Flightr that night but only one of us got to take it 
People kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight. 
We even went to the airport and were on the phone for hrs and no help at all. Everyone said different things. 
not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable.. 
flights 1970, 1366, and 1552 will fly over after 1 am on your way into @BostonLogan - mind taking ocean approach so we can sleep? 
Clients got ZERO, in 32 years career never thought this was possible.2 suitcases worth thousands of $$ in Italian clothing robbed.

Third flight in a row for my wife with her TV not working... 
maybe have a supervisor find out why the international checkin at FTL hasn't moved in 20 minutes yet employees picked up 100 pizza

Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone? 
Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn't have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting. 
any thoughts on waiver of change fees for travel out of Boston this weekend? 
Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done. 
has screwed me over for the last time.  @SouthwestAir, glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService 
my credit card company accidentally marked my jet blue tickets as fraud, then corrected their mistake and reposted the money. 
But jet blue had Cancelled Flighted my ticket &amp; never reissued it. 
My card company and I explained the issue over the phone when I was in Mexico. I purchased a new ticket over the phone. 
When I arrived at the airport, I was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert. 
we made it safe and sound. Thank you for the safe travels. 
I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept. 
actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone? 
No, it didn't all work out. I called Jet Blue from Mexico to address the fraud alert with Capital One on the line. Rebooked. 
@NHLBruins repping the Bruins in Cleveland at Rock n Roll HOF &amp; The Christmas Story house #JetBlueBruins http://t.co/JKnWuGJ778 
Then en route to the airport the rebooked ticket was refunded. 
thanks 
Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved? 
You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right? 
I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I've had with Jet Blue. 
Does @AirCanada not take fraud as seriously? 
Seems a few of my friends speak highly as well. Now we just need to find a decent priced way to go from YVR to SEA and overnight.

Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you? 
thanks to Julian at login for getting me onto an earlier flight back to DCA 
My bag is missing from 1099 landed over 6 hours ago. Help!

Wish you would make Austin, TX a hub. Missing you as my ‚Äúonly‚Äù airline for all my biz travel since I moved from BOS. :( 
I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time! 
I can't. I don't have acces to a phone rn. My iPhone broke. :/ would rather change it now then Late Flightr. 
should I check in my awesome bag on my flight or carry it on... Decisions... 
okie doke! Knowing you, you will fix this ;) 
no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd  time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans 
I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there? 
what is the Mosiac 800 #? 
excited for my first flight w/ you today! It's delayed though- can you give me the 411? Flight number 989 from Boston to DC 
that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled. 
 Ahoy from a loyal #AllYouCanJetPass holder! When do you anticipate direct US flights to #Havana, #Cuba? (#JetBlue #Vacation)

I was able to access it by using the drop down instead of clicking on the tab. 
thanks for your help! #jetbluesofly 
How long ago can a trip have taken place for me to still get credit if I didn't apply my TrueBlue # when I booked? 
now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What's wrong with you guys?? http://t.co/wVGpp3Ymz1 
yes slc on 4/19 
what's the hold up with flight 1553? boarding should've taken place 30 minutes ago. 
Hi. How do I claim points on a 1800-flowers order after I purchased? I totally forgot to put in the promo code. 
not cool to announce a flight "delay" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help. 
quick question, to pay for a second bag, do I have to do it online or can I do it at the airport? 
RT‚Äú@JetBlue: @Peaches275 Oh no! Unfortunately, the code must be entered at the time of purchase in order to qualify for the points.‚Äù 
@TSA JetBlue never disappoints ! 
you reimbursed everyone on the flight a portion of their ticket. I still love JetBlue! Best American airline! 
and of course that was supposed to say Logan, not login 
Vegas, San Francisco, Baltimore, San Diego and Philadelphia so far! I'm a very frequent business traveler. 
I want to enter the family pooling contest, it says "by 2/19" on the website, can I please enter still! 
That'd be nice! Hoping to rack up enough miles to take a trip to Seattle and enjoy a perfect latte in the city of coffee. 
1st flight of the morning, flying with a toddler. Will the plane be heated to a comfortable temp before boarding starts. #ItsCold 
is giving me false hope of ever getting home 
not to get into semantics here but "by" means "within the extent or period of; during" and it is still technically 2/19 #dictionary 
keep going back and forth with being able to board and then not. But great agents in savannah! 
you service agents at MCO are great, but their are not enough of them working right now!

can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are... 
if I'm about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed. 
all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific. 
Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight... 
Flight I want to book was $320 one day; went to purchase next day &amp; price doubled to $737. Inquiring on chance it may go down? 
I don't want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice! 
Same exact flight too. Love JetBlue. Really want to fly with ya'll. But that's a little pricey for basic (not Mint). BOS to SFO. 
but thank you! Love, an anxious flyer. 
thanks JB!! This is why I üíô you! 
Been a member since 2007. Looking to travel next week 2/24-2/27. Couldn't book right away due to all the snow; I'm in BOS. 
oh yes! I hope you expand to other airports soon so I can fly you to see my family each year!!!! 
:/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe. 
If your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like I can't fly JetBlue this time around, can't afford that price 
Well, I fly into Huntsville, AL. But I'd take either Nashville or Birmingham too! 
do you do any discounts for volunteer firefighters? 
Guess I'll wait another 24 hrs in hopes rate goes down &amp; is more reasonable. Fingers crossed. Cutting it close to my travel dates. 
Although it wasn't totally the answer I was looking for, I appreciate the prompt response. 
excellent. you guys are the best

@AmericanAir ah ha! I misread the end date as being 2014 not 2015. Thanks for clarifying :) 
can I switch my seat for my trip on Sunday? 
Thanks for the reminder of a few older flights I'd taken and the easy access to add points to my new JB account! Awesome service. 
I lost a day at the airport and off my trip, I should be compensated for the inconvenience!!!!! 
what's up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm? 
has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem 
I have more flights that I'd love to redeem for some points but they're a little over a year old. Is there a historical limit? 
No, it is one I'm trying to make, but it is probably too Late Flight. I did not see an email that I could call. Pittsburgh International. 
before departure, while people who are delayed get up to $200 to compensate their time.. 
saving my sanity. Leaving it behind for sunshine. #escape #FL #bliss #travel #InDenial #WhatFrozenPipes http://t.co/6TtzEJV3hY 
poor storm customer service, 1hr takeoff delay waiting for the snack cart, rude steward (no names) and I love you guys. #TrueBlue 
dang. Pandora? Does it look like it may get pushed back more or is this likely it? 
I will. Thank you! 
will I be compensated for delays or Cancelled Flightlation? 
messaged you, thanks 
No worries. Time flew in the terminal and now we're taking off. Thanks again!

Two delays.  A little proactive communication goes a long way. #howhardcanthatreallybe? 
- loving Capt Joe on our flight from BOS to SFO #633. This should be fun! 
can't seem to DM you guys.. JDHADP 
captain "takes as lot of muscles to frown but JUST A FEW TO SMILE. Y'all ready to go flyin?" I mean... Now I am!

I'm flying your airline just out of #LGA üò∑ 
do you have any afternoon flights going from BQN to JFK? I only seem to find early morning flights. 
okay thanks. Hope to be flying with you guys soon! 
do you have direct flights to and from Bos to St Lucia or Antigua? 
do you know when the schedule for dec 2015 will be released? 
lets see.  You could pay for my Negroni with bitcoin. @JetBlue 
Noooo!! Why is our previously direct flight from FLL&gt;SFO diverted to LAS? Now arriving almost 2 hrs Late Flightr. üëé 
Did you discontinue nonstop service from SJC to BOS? Can't find 471 or 472 anywhere 
Ah grasshopper, your twitterz kung fu no good.  Hire geeks. http://t.co/8MWItRi9kF 
When will you release November flights for Flight Booking Problems? 
flight 691 from bos to Tampa takeoff 40 min Late Flight 
Please come to Indianapolis! 
maybe announce the delay so we don't sit on the plane on the runway for an hour+ before taking off 
...second incident of lost baggage.  I sent you a DM.  Thoughts? 
why must you always delay my Late Flight night Orlando flights? üíî 
No, the flight wasn't until 9:51pm, but it's already been delayed. 
- looking forward to it when we finally take off. 
y'all got prices for the low?? 
Jan 5? That's not summer http://t.co/TpzhjX7Hbt

Thanks. Which day of the week is the direct?  The flights I saw went thru JFK   ‚òÄÔ∏è 
so what about California 
thanks! 
imma need the hook up tho 
looks like their inflatable car seats got left on the plane, so I guess they'll be back sometime!! #savethoseseats 
Why not deal with that while the plane's on the ground instead of diverting the plane &amp; adding 2 hrs to the flight? 
flight1407, it's been a long day! Arrived from London at 11 this morning 
I'm a trying ! But I'm tired and getting grumpy ! 
I tried a burger which was good but expensive! Were lead to believe that food in the USA is cheap butnot here! 
yes and not boarding at 6:44. Good luck with that. Push wheels up to reality.  Dare you. 
yes. Filed a claim and they issued $30 credit as a courtesy. The whole thing seems exceptionally uncourteous to me. 
process begins 6:48 
question, flying for the 1st time with my 16mont old son...do I need to bring anything for him? Birth certificate/S.S. card etc? 
were boarding now I'm really not impressed. I've learnt a very valuable lesson . 
i'm sorry.  Boarding chaos is underway.  Please query again post scrum. 
thanks...

oh. Makes sense. My bad. 
flight 672 delayed from 9:30 to 11:47 now, still sitting on runway over 15 minutes so far. Air travel at its best. 
says the person who hasn't been delayed for hours and now sitting on a runway with a wailing baby ;) 
you're flight attendants suck and are always rude :( 4th bad experience with JetBlue tonight :/ 
now we are delayed until 1:02! This is ridiculous 
you're customer service is terrible. #NeverAgain #flywhonotblue

It's not ideal, but it's okay. Better Late Flight than never! :)

I fly w/u as much as I can, however your kiosks were broken in SYR and there was 1 woman working the ticket counter.. She had a 
serious attitude. I was in the fault for running a tad behind but before she even knew my name or my flight info she ASSURED Me 
that I missed my flight. I had to book this flight extremely last minute due to a family death, there's no excuse for attitude in 
the first place but I really didn't need the extra stress at this already terrible time. Oh by the way, I made the flight with 30 
minutes to spare. 
You have very unhappy customer. After waiting 20 min on hold, rude &amp; uncaring rep has now frozen my acct. can't print bdng pass!

it seems I never received an ID, just a password. 
@amybruni @DIRECTTV but of course! :-) #bestdressed #bluecarpet 
I can't call right now. My baby just fell asleep. 
I clear that folder regularly and JetBlue is white listed so it never got to me.

why wouldn't you just credit it right to my account instead of having a separate sign on. That seems pretty ridiculous. 
can u see what's holding up flt 1002 bags? One bag came out nothing else for 10 minutes 
Hello! Can you tell me if you currently fly to Hawaii? Thanks!

You already Cancelled Flightled the one b4 us to DCA 
what's the status of flight 1272 diverted to RIC?  When will it depart back for LGA? 
making a bad situation worse. Cancelled Flighted flight, making us stay overnight in SXM. Won't provide vouchers to stay in a different hotel 
Tell me at what point will u realize u can't fly into DCA tonight- u Cancelled Flightled the 1pm when will u Cancelled Flight the 5:26 
we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least. 
- trying to fly from BOS to JFK. Flight delayed. Traveling with kids. Book a hotel or are we getting out tonight? 
what good with the inflight WiFi? 
status of flight 684 from MCO to LGA tomorrow? 
I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything. 
there is no supervisor available, so they couldn't do anything. 
I sure hope you guys get me to DC to speak tomorrow! &amp; @JohnNosta &amp; @United: I'm winning here with @JetBlue 
You guys need pillows on these rockers to really knock it out of the park ... just sayin ... 
not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start. 
Counting on your flight 989 to get to DC! 
why haven't you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight?  Everyone is saying travel is treacherous. 
your website is seriously horrible and so is your  call center!! Almost makes it tempting to fly someone else!! #sodone

 thanks for response! Crew has been VERY patient with us, but they are also frustrated. Wouldn't be so bad but airport is closed! 
can you let me know status of flight #454 PBI-JFK delayed 2.5hours now on board problem with hatch.. 
do bags still fly for free anymore? 
you are doing a horrible job at JFK...you need to rethink how you put these routes together. Unprofessional 
I missed a goal On @NHLonNBCSports because of your Inept male stewardess. I should have landed already but I havent taken off yet. 
I will when I land. 
You can pass that along to my wife, daughter, daughter's friend, my elderly mother-in-law.  They spent several hours waiting. 
You please help to save my daughters life @JetBlue for details Go here @Help_Lindsey 
thank you 
is that supposed to change in the near future? 
thanks! Yes! order me a rum and coke and get me a hotel voucher because the floor and chairs aren't so cushy here...! 
thank you üòä standing in line now! 
Y U NO LET ME OUT AND MAKE FUN SIZE COOKIES #stuckonaplane #sos #babyfood 
flight attendant was hesitant to give me more baby sized cookies 
is amazing. Had a short delay. They gave me $150 credit! It was literally pretty much my fault I missed the flight. 
@Maddie_Flood Your airline sounds outstanding and your Twitter feed is clearly extremely useful. Keep up the great work üòä

I am But Your customer service is Brutal. 
that is not what your employee at Logan told me. I finally got one to meet my daughter on her first solo flight after rude rep :( 
Thanks for taking me back home today despite Pandora's best efforts to Cancelled Flight the flight. #jetblue #backhome #noplacelikehome 
everytime I come back to Boston it's a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue? 
thank you thank you!  I finally set up the jetblue app!  Yay! 
I'm curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate 
@dgruber1700  oh wow and I'm complaining about two hour on the run way shucks JetBlue NOT GOOD your service was better than this 
you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck 
Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting 
Follow me pls? 
I know you guys are super busy but is flight 1222 an a320 or e190? 
 Alright I hope. My JetBlue app is showing a change in my seats and online shows an a320.  Don't want any surprises 
I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more. 
thank you! I know the weather in #Boston isn't great. Everyone's tired 
@SouthwestAir @VirginAmerica @AmericanAirBR download jeokoo the American app for air travelers 
a voucher.. I can't believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face.. 
great flight on a brand new jet. Great seating. Beautiful plane. Big fan of this airline. 
Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. üòí 
thanks for the response - when is the next flight after the 9:48 flight? 
just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year. 
it's ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired 
no. Not boarding order. Someone boarded with. Service Animal which a member of my party was allergic to and because the flight was 
full the six of us had to leave flight. And now have to wait a whole day to get a flight and my kids will miss school. 
should I expect delays at dca for 7am departure?  Going to Orlando on flight 723 
thanks for getting us to NYC -JFK really safely. :-) But srsly? How long does it take to get our checked bags? #eternity #5amMisery 
Yep, still waiting for bags at #JFK. What's the holdup? Looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..?? 
Thanks! See you soon! 
They just came out. Thanks for the follow-up. That's why you're the best! 
@sylvie75015 Good morning, Sylvie! Have a great flight! #yourock‚Äù &gt; Thank you #JetBlue! @mxo42 @henrikwagner73 #JetBlueRocks 
some woman stole my seat on the plane but I was the one that had to sit elsewhere. Is that standard protocol? 
okay thank you! I'll check with them again! 
my flight 475 Cancelled Flighted due to lavatory problems. Can't confirm if they are gonna get a flight from Boston Logan Int 
I'm so sorry I cheated on you with @Delta @DeltaAssist. Please take me back. I wore protection. 
that's where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO? 
well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100%  confirmed 
how about an update on flight 475 leaving tf green delayed 
 FLL to MDE, great flight, great customer service, THANKS! 2 mths waiting  @AmericanAir  to speak to a human at customer service 
 I see my flight from Boston to Pitts is ok from this afternoon. Did you have any delays for the morning flight? 
suck and their customer services are the worst  whats the point of having a loyalty scheme that they don't honor #badairline 
won't see my money again after their poor service    should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue??? 
we are on flight 751 and were returning to the gate can you provide any information? 
I travel for business twice a week and after the @AmericanAir fiasco, I'll be flying blue more often. Thanks. 
yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight. 
@fllairport best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won't put you standby? #stranded 
 I'm at 4:05  will be nasty in Boston. Have family driving 90 min to pick me up from Erie think flight - what if Cancelled Flighted? 
fly 2301 delayed do to ice at JFK ... Can I switch to a Late Flightr flight for free 
you can 100% confirm that? 
we need an ETA please 
on flight 622 from Nassau to JFK. Not showing Cancelled Flightled yet but assuming it will be? Any info? 
ok we got as far as Atlantic City due to JFK being closed. Can you get us to HPN or LGA?? Please? 
ok should I start looking into other flights? 
why is my 910 flight listed on time when its 904AM and I'm not on the plane yet? http://t.co/iEG2ObcEpp 
 will do. 
note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I'm not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ 
done, thank you! 
hi is there a way we can check to track the flight that will arrive &amp; that will be our flight to depart. 
Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm . 
Great service from PBI to HPN! Thanks. 
you want me to talk to the wall? 
Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY! 
can I say other than when it comes to my #BrandLoveAffair w/ @jetblue ur my #soulandinspiration https://t.co/IGkoGyWksr #umosaicmecrazy 
why don't YOU tell them to update the boards?! 
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ yall are really better then American Airlines though. 
..... No crew at our gate. 
all your online resources  say we're on time, but clearly we are not.  This is not very information age of you... 
that's cause we're TrueBlue! It's ur #love that keeps liftin' me #higherandhigher https://t.co/xGfS6tJTMo http://t.co/ixM3t5mIZc 
they miraculously fixed the plane #kudos to shoe ever it was 
flt 136 from PHX. Delayed 2 hrs, circle 1 hr, divert to upstate NY, just sitting for 1 hr No communication #horrible 
always #mosaicmecrazy #sunrise #bestairline #nofilterneeded &amp; how can you not love #FlyFi‚Ä¶ http://t.co/NY6CS7jRuV 
 hmmm it says im following you. We just got de-iced, but still haning around for the runway to clear.. 
woulda been nice of you to let us know that or post it!!! Your boards still show the flight on time!!! 
is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc! 
I hear you and safety is #1! I think we can get to JFK though now so let's help the pilots, passengers &amp; crew get there safely! 
Just left #LaGuardia now...#Sunshine in a little over 2 hours 
Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152? 
thx, social media person! 
Charleston - from your app guys as of a few minutes ago!!! http://t.co/sEUlpvfn95 
well, the last update was in the right direction, at least! I'll keep my fingers crossed. 
had a great experience working with Glenn Coles at Buffalo-Niagara Airport!! Top notch employee 
do bags still fly free or have you started charging? thanks! 
your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0 
isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job? 
got it. thanks the quick reply. 
have a cpap machine for sleep apnea. Is this OK to carry on if I also have a small bag for clothes? 
flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we're getting on 
just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I'll document and send details, off to Boston 
yup we know, not your fault, just not ideal sittin for over an hour but as always your staff is great! 
seriously? System down? No IT? 
Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue 
how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really? 
whatever your lil #mint heart desires! http://t.co/WmX12F33ZC 
When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as "on time" #updateyourwebsite #489 
That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway. 
flight16? 
it's only because I'm wearing #TrueBlueColors! 
here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass 
I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job 
#489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board 
she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight 
It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate 
I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT.... 
then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it 
Thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse 
if I had my tux, it'd be a date! #UMosaicMeCrazy http://t.co/hap4gboSTU 
That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time. 
get flight 16 into the air 
after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards 
and ask she load the bag for my flight 
That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours. 
don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12 
 Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen. 
what's the delay if the system isn't down? 
Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks 
still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers. 
I love #JetBlue ! #FlyFi when will we be able to charge our devices on domestic #A320 flights?! Thanks! http://t.co/obqIro1bUJ 
any idea when the flight will actually take off? 
it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous. 
things happen it's ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport 
thanks for the info. Already doing it now before we board! Looking forward to the future upgrades! #JetBlue http://t.co/5Db9eSBNzG 
it's sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What's the real reason? 
BOS. Everything current now. Thanks for the follow up 
just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful 
your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!! 
unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you 
they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue? 
u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/DPX3yoGTEj 
flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK 
how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing 
really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk. 
where is the "award winning service"? 
what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather. 
she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock! 
795 to Austin 
Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We're making a pact to never fly u again 
@2littlebirds Beautiful shot.. Thanks for sharing. Using #FlyFi to post? ;)‚Äù Your welcome! Not on this flight. It was a quickie;) 
Thanks for the THIRD gate change http://t.co/UfBdr5AxeO 
when will the system be up and running? 
according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there 
there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures 
and have empty "help" desks 
they were amazing and thank you! 
letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you. 
thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE 
too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you. 
waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane! 
this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board 
Landing! As usual great flight wiyh a great crew. Hello sunny West Palm Beach ! #jetbluerocks 
don't I always? 
@Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?! 
@CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless 
flight to Orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... So they've made movies and alcohol complimentary. That works 
thank you. We are finally at the gate. 
nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this. 
get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!? 
if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped. 
no excuse though for 3 gate changes though. 
JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too. 
Customer of the year? http://t.co/epqqONHO2H 
your hold music sucks. 
Promo Watch Phone $33 at Amazon check http://t.co/leNaOwFyvU 
thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children. 
So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs. 
Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am 
I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the "T5 experience" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month. 
name is Enzo üòä RT @JetBlue : @Setorii Well hello there pooch! What's your name? #dog http://t.co/dLh9138HBg 
it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed. 
flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy... 
5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again? 
Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers? 
thanks! Have a good Sunday. 
flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology? 
At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong 
thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations 
According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet! 
My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong 
@2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!‚Äù Thank you! 
what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time! 
I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO 
Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected 
any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home. 
 Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help! 
I have a reservation for tomorrow morning but trying to get back 2 night bc other flight was going to jfk. Can I get on list at CTG 
#1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky 
also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight. 
I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us. 
our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun. 
If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it. 
I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey. 
if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time? 
 I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was. 
thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I'll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business 
still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row. 
flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great! 
thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free? 
Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in 
Perhaps you need to start recruiting @msbgu ;) 
I only fly Jet Blue 
When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ. 
come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip. 
You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise. 
of course I am!!‚úàÔ∏è 
w/ edits: Dear @msbgu , your MBAs need better benefits. They should work for us. How can we meet them? 
Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-(
I look forward to that do much! 
is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate 
the whole plane. Flight 561 from LGA to PBI http://t.co/4Ktk2hsmGy 
no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours.... 
Awesome! #bestairlineever 
my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail ‚ò∫üëçüëç 
you guys rock! 
your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags! 
backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!! 
early last month via Expedia-there's an extra middle name and initial attached to my last name 
should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight üòï 
I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs 
I usually do-but I didn't make the Flight Booking Problems this time-that'll teach me! Yea I have that going for me at least haha 
thanks for replying-I feel a little better we'll see how it goes ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏è 
hope so! looks nice and warm in San Juan üå¥ 
now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs 
118 to Boston still sitting 
wondering if it's possible for my colleague and I to get on an earlier flight LAX&gt;JFK tomorrow. Can you help? 
What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness! 
Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! üòï 
what a great experience on flight from SFO to JFK; seats, service, food, everything is top quality. I will be back. Very soon! 
is there wifi on he plain 
hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs? 
soon as I can, sending my son home with you Saturday. @JetBlue 
every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble?? 
You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 "goodwill credit" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it. 
love it as always! 
does not fit in 140 
why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches! 
You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue. 
thank you guys! You are the best! üôå‚úàÔ∏è 
at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination? 
You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of .... 
is your partnership with Hawaiian live? Earn Hawaiian miles flying Jetblue ? IF so, how do I add @HawaiianAir to my JB Flight Booking Problems ? 
flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in. 
thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed 
exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer 
Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey 
where is it coming from? I thought Tampa? 
oh. And thank you for responding 
follow for DM please 
btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month's @USChamber aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock 
You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2 
You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF? 
What confirmation number? 
Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to 
@amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA‚úàÔ∏èBOS 
woof I'm on the red cArpet http://t.co/iIdrbLNOoX 
no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx! 
5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday? 
the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal ;) 
thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable! 
Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks! 
of my tray table is broken what do i do? 
being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd 
a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4 
you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven 
Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you. 
it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK 
from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing 
never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2 
For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks! 
what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting. 
why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8 
Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now. 
I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U 
kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw 
why are there so many delays to north east cities? 
once you go blue you don't go back 
if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2 
What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air. 
flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket! 
they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your "terms" response is insulting.  #jetblue 
do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu 
if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail 
so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied? 
you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids! 
Pittsburgh 
flight 2008 
thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot 
I have a disabled seat in row 6 do I get to board earlier? 
This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj 
sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated. 
the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight. 
Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI. 
Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a 
Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx 
Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0... 
cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs. 
anything serious I should worry about? 
Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger 
finally! Finally! 
I have someone driving me, it's best to get a wheelchair once I get inside? 
I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue 
 I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!! 
I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight.. 
that wasn't delayed or cabcelled 
thanks for answering my questions! 
last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal. 
I think I have it selected already ‚ò∫Ô∏è 
@JetBlue: The last email response - "we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol 
the man with the smell left nd now there's this stupid girl asking me questions. can yall help. 
I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper. 
Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do? 
thanks for help. Can't wait to travel with! And get out of the snow. 
Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi 
yes, please get me the seats we paid for. 
thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus 
If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats. 
WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more. 
yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home... 
thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back 
Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat. 
why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem? 
how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right. 
all day 
thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks 
ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate 
Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed 
thanks for the response. We are hopeful. 
no m'good. Just get me home 
@FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.‚Äù Me and JetBlue are #BFF üôè 
hey me and my family have questions on a trip to Disney world that we are doing in April . Please follow me so I could dm you guys 
Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now. 
thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned. 
what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades? 
just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home! 
4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day. 
Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service 
that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not. 
aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then! 
okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break 
Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG 
I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue 
you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether 
your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers 
Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying 
flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc? 
well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch 
your gif game is strong. 
hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports. 
thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. üòâ Can I tweet at the TSA?? 
 I did.  They have no idea where it is. 
If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;) 
id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom? 
I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given 
A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on? 
oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t 
2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification 
We're flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p. 
you're taking me to New Orleans in two weeks so I'll picture that while I shiver #forevercold 
I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant 
ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're "watching" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars 
Thank you. Fingers crossed. 
how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars 
@julesdameron "Considering?" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality 
thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then 
after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible! 
Thanks!  I made it üòÉ 
I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed 
@shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed. 
Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems? 
@ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy 
you're still the best 
Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9 
by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk. 
being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice 
the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost. 
Love you guysüòçüòçüòç http://t.co/3X9NRUOvtS 
Ok. Thanks for your help. 
im still waiting??? No answer!! 
ill call in the morning. too upset right now. 
 if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris... 
are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous 
I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on üòí 
even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people? 
had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome! 
hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this 
okay so anything using contactless EMV should work, just your internal testing and training is currently Apple Pay specific? 
awesome 
thank you! 
thank you! Hopefully it's soon! We are supposed to leave at 11:23 
"Goodwill" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136 
Can you take @Cosmopolitan off your blacklist... trying to work :( 
pilot: "Don't worry folks there's a backup for the backup for every part of this plane." Thanks guy 
aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no 
such a bummer.  But I understand it's a business deal. Thanks for answering me!  Much less sad now. 
i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimiüò≠ why dont you guys go to maimi??? 
you just tight that you're #59 on the world's best airlines list &amp; @VirginAtlantic is ranked higher! @VirginAtlantic here I come! 
I do! The best airline wifi ever. Thank you! 
THANK YOU! I am your new big fan :) 
But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous. 
the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors. 
#611 from JFK to LAS still delayed? 
@zakkohane pretty sure he's saying Ricoh had great service down at BOS ;) #happytohelp 
Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not. 
üëç. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;) 
didn't work. Fly-fi plus couldn't access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed 
ha ha! Can I get a wake up call at boarding time please?  Large coffee, extralight extra sweet please! 
well deserved! Just wish the rest of my @JetBlue experience today measured up to their example! 
- Fix your @#$&amp; jet bridges.  40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting!  #jetblues http://t.co/ncB2oNcS9i 
@amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/ 
over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man! 
that's ok! It just sure seemed like it when JetBlue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching.. Haha 
apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today? 
ok thanks. Safety first. 
Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a "courtesy report" 
any idea what's going on at terminal five at JFK? Seems to be zero traffic movement 
sorry, should have specified I meant ground traffic trying to get into the terminal 
is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes. 
2 words: "staff training." What a joke- 
thank you for getting me home. And despite all odds I have reunited with my delinquent Southwest luggage. Now homeward 
- WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow.  No snow on weather map!!!  WTF!!! 
mint seats are AWESOME! :-) @emaleesugano best business class in the US!!! 
I understand delays.  We are all looking at a tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow, hence delay. 
other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail 
Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail 
Didn't find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail. 
with the free wifi #impressive #FlyFi http://t.co/T1RYpzEBc8 
appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was "There is nothing we can do" idk if that's what you mean 
Woo! Update! Flight 915 is now possibly delayed by more than 2hrs!  Power of positive thinking, people. 
last sleep in Cali... back to JFK tomorrow night.  Looking forward to an another amazing flight with you all :) 
wall separating in row 1. #safetyconcerns http://t.co/zTrDwV0N4l 
flight was two days ago. Flight 1918 from POS. 
terrible landing on 915 
flight from JFK-SFO was pure awesomeness. Mint Class and Tim our attendant was the best! Other airlines, take notes! 
for SFO, but hopefully you'll add PDX soon ‚Äú@JetBlue We added two new destinations (FLL and SFO) from Las Vegas in the last year!‚Äù 
is so sloooooow today 
Rats, that's a bummer! 
not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better 
Thanks JB. Actually, As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them. 
are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We're just sittin' here on the tarmac  waiting. 
no one yet but some, fl 8162 
Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting "Webpage not available" after submitting online form 
as courtesy to Mosaic members or anyone, a request for water should be attended promptly. Daniel in flight 1557, should know better 
shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta. 
Yes, I filed yesterday around noon. I have a claim number but they haven't contacted me yet. 
2324 from Orlando to Dca ! And my awesome flight attendant is Robert! 
no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed. 
653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster. 
yeah I'm aware of that. Hence my original msg to you. 
How can I best track deals and special flight offers? I'm liking your international options... 
said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. üòí 
@martysg you *know* how I love you, JB, but honestly, when you have complex feedback, those pull-down sub-option forms=maddening. 
lol at your "estimated departure time." Plane hasn't even started boarding yet. You can't even get your delays right. 
what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight? 
 would love to go to Hawaii to visit pearl harbor.

I don't want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :((( 
I wish you all the best of luck :-) I'm enjoying the luxurious free!! amount of leg space rn. Thanks 
That's what I planned on but Boston traffic due to recent weather was insane! If I had been expedited I would have made it. 
keeps getting better. No water on the plane. 
I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check &amp; wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset 
 any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun 
thank you!! 
what's the easiest way to get a ticket receipt? Can I get one at check in or can I get one online? Thanks! 
Thank you for the free flyfi!! Makes an already great airline even better! #jetblue #Boston #westpalmbeach #flybetter 
Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF 
it was booked through work but added upgrade on seat. Need the upgrade receipt. 
thanks 
Haha. Thanks. You guys are great. Unlike the @nyjets. ;-) #GoPatriots!

Thank you, but that isn't really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site. 
thanks! Calling right now! 
sounds fun! How does that work? 
nope. The "regular" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS. 
...and when did your legal department start running your social media channels? 
I would like the actual email address so I can follow up. thank you. 
@jeff_hofmann @DeniseJTaylor @LaurieAMeacham Good one! And indeed, it's JetBlue's finest day in history!

Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner 
good to know, thanks so much! 
All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what's a little delay right. 
I believe it's Irina. On the flip-side, super disappointed that EatUp Cafe isn't available on this BOS --&gt; SFO flight today.

For one way, not letting me select TO city....strange...and now some fairs look "normal" ????

- I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours) 
- I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything? 
- Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner? 
but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner? 
- Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.

you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3 
we would have been up in the air by now. Now our new plane we've been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 2/3

I appreciate the credit for my troubles but the lack of personal response troubles me. 
Come on and provide service from Destin- Fort Walton Beach Airport 
many thanks, as always your employees are professional and courteous. Whenever I have the option, you are my go-to airlines. 
are @AskAmex Amex Plat holders provided access or a credit in the Airspace Lounge in JKF? 
like BaeJet Airways, amirite?

‚Äú@JetBlue: @terrybrokebad Right back at ya!‚Äù

having trouble signing in to TrueBlue today, despite right credentials. getting "We are not able to sign you in" msg. 
Is there an issue with your website and logging on? (App too?) I know I am entering info correctly but cannot sign in! :( 
your wifi is a lie and i hate you 
Thanks for the quick reply! Just wanted to make sure it wasn't just my account :)

what are the chances of actually flying out of Charleston today?? Cold, rainy weather in the south of all places... 
luggage fees? won't b flying JB again! at least #AA gives platinum pass 2 bags! tired of overchging bg herded like cattle2slaughter 
Stop trying to make #fleek happen! #PointsMe 
can't book a flight because of outdated, forced opt-in "Verified by Visa" nonsense. Help a girl out? I just want to get to @sxsw 
Are there really no flights from the Bay Area to Chicago anymore? Lame. So lame. 
I had to call back five times to get someone on the phone who knew what they were doing. By that time my getaway went up by $200. 
I'm not sure if you can do anything to help me with that, but if you can that'd be great. 
awesome, thanks! on hold now. 
flight 117. proud to fly Jet Blue! 
flying w/ infant for the 1st time, can I bring a canister of powder formula for a carry on and/or use my plastic formula divider? 
thanks great recap. I wouldn't have been able to sleep!  I was nervous the bad guy was getting away. üòâ 
great. 
I've spent three hours talking to all different people, most of which couldn't help. I probably won't be using JetBlue again. 
Not for the dates or destination I'm headed üòî 
upset with the lack of communication we've received for our "on time" flight 1170 out of MCO 
just wondering if the website is having issues today. Trying to book a flight with my visa I always use and its rejecting it. 
Hello Good afternoon how are you, I need know how much flying for summer from june 13th. 
Yeah I have! I'm on it!! Looking for specific dates - I will just keep checking daily for a fare drop

Cancelled Flighted my flight. Went with another airline 2 leave 2day. They Cancelled Flighted also. Called JetBlue &amp; got same flight but now $250 moreüë∫ 
ive tried on my phone and laptop :( 
Ok and in Dominican Republic what numbers? 
did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24 
now at 57 minutes waiting on Silver Elite line for someone to pick up! Help! 
thank you for the information. 
but by Cancelled Flighting my flight and pushing me to the next day I'd lose $150 hotel which was why I was trying to get a same-day flight. 
Submitted, hoping for quick decision, tied to another donation we just received:
Proposal- 27th Annual Gala
Org- Boundless Readers 
they booked me for tomorrow. It's $250 higher. My 1st reservation is PGFRYZ. Get me on standby list 4 tonight would help.

update on Flight 462 would be appreciated when you have time, thanks 
everyone is here but our pilots are no where to be found and my last flight the plane was dirty that I had to clean my area &amp; seat! 
They weren't on any flight, they just came Late Flight. Your JetBlue employee just informed us!
