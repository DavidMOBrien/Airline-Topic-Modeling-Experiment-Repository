how's us 1797 looking today? 
@AmericanAir How r u supposed to change flights when u can't get thru to reservations? #OneHourOnHold 
reservations had me on hold for 2 hours only to hang up...smh 😕 
we have no choice but to pay another $50 to go to the airport in the hopes that we will be treated better by a rep. 
I have been on hold with your Gold reservations line for OVER 3 HOURS now. Flight Cancelled Flightled. Trying to rebook. 
we are on the 2pm flight FLL to PHL and then connection to MAN. However, with the delays we might miss it. Can we go earlier? 
your service has been awful in Boston and I had to pay 25 extra dollars than I was supposed too I am very dissatisfied #mad 
great job today In ruining 45 people's vacation. Thanks to your incompetent pilot and staff we have all now missed our flights 
I’ve had my flight Cancelled Flightled twice now, and after 5 minutes of automated questions, the phone just goes to a busy signal. Help? 
@USAirways It's been Cancelled Flighted. Your SM response is slow. 
Almost 4 hours and coin now. Understand higher call volume, but this is unacceptable. 
can't even get on hold to wait to speak to someone-awesome 
You need to contact me ASAP. #Furious 
it was supposed to be a carry on and in Pittsburgh  coming to Boston it was a carry on 
I filed a report in Atlanta. My bags are in Charlotte, NC. 24 hours Late Flightr and still can't find my luggage ... @USAirways 
it takes a month? 
thanks for the reply, hoping everything is cleared up in Charlotte by Monday 
@AmericanAir you make Spirit look like the gem of air travel. You haven't handle this winter storm very well... 
your chairmans phone is down. what other number can i use? 
How soon is possible? I boarded the plane the 1st time at 6:30 am and it is now after 11:30 am and I'm still where I started. 
 well its 11:45am and just got an email that my 11am flight is delayed-thats not right 
 thanks I hope I get to my destination 
please give Tara G a pat on the back and praise.  She was very very helpful.  She is at PHL member lounge 
I got up at 2 am for a 5 am flight from bos to Charlotte which I found was Cancelled Flightled once I got to the gate (1) 
on your website and on your boards at Logan it said it was on time, so we went through security and got to the gate (2) 
no we haven't because we've been in the same line at the service desk for an 1hr and 1/2 now in the same spot. 
I did and it's been a disaster. You had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh 
you have the ability to switch my flight to @AmericanAir but you cannot tell me where my bags are. 
I expect something more than telling me to see an agent to rebook my flight... 
your customer service is horrible 
and it still says it's on time on your website btw 
been trying to talk with a dividend miles rep for 2 days now. I have been holding for over 2 hours each day. What are my options? 
thank you for blowing my vacation. Couldn't get me anywhere today to make my reservation and also lost 2 bags of mine! 
thanks 
No kidding. Oy. 
no warm weather hubs means no Mexico for us.  And I can't go anywhere else since you lost my bags. I hope you attempt to rectify 
tried twice today on hold for 30 min each time. i have things to do so can't live on hold dealing w/ your customer serv failures 
Thanks for the info but have been trying for over 24hrs and no luck. Flight dep. Today. Need 2 change 2 tomorrow or Thursday 
I didn't even leave the airport and you sent 2 of my bags to Philadelphia! 
will do. Hoping for a voucher for a future flight #Optimistic 
This is dating back to Nov. I have been sent back and forth between you and @eDreams_en. It's a disgrace. 
 to arrive the plane I'm sitting on needs to take off...wish someone would tell us what the holdup is 
want to bump up my seet to first class for two Cancelled Flightlations in 24hrs?? what a joke 
The phone line disconnects. How can I be in the queue to be answered when the phone line simply disconnects when I call? 

That is not an excuse to have such a poor website Flight Booking Problems options! My yearly vacation is about to fall through, ubetter do smth! 
flight #3900 fro ORF to PHL. 
still crickets from customer service. 
Flight 2069 from JFK to Charlotte, then 3750 from Charlotte to Birmingham. 2 previous flights to HSV were Cancelled Flightled. 
Now I am probably going to miss my connection in Charlotte, so I will have to drive home for the funeral. 
Why is there no contact email for customer complaints? 
hundreds of people in line and less than half the desks being manned at CLT. Help? 
I can't believe that you would refer me to a number no one seems to be getting through. Really? I need help ASAP! 
I was completely ripped of by US Airways today never fly this airline  I am contacting my local news 
They charged me for a flight they Cancelled Flightled, unbelievable and unheard of 
when I call it says y'all are too busy and to call back Late Flightr.  this is terrible customer service.  what will you do about it? 
How can I change without penalty and not have to call customer service 
Just contaced EYEWITNESS NEWS about the ripoff the Cancelled Flighted now they want me to pay 
I need someone from management to contact me I was flying to a funeral won't make it now to add to my pain they want me 2 pay 
Im researching a flight &amp; noticed a small issue w/class of service between your site &amp; other sites. Could Reservations help me? 
&amp; there are seats together, they just have fees. Seems if I'm taking a 5am flight the least you can do is wave the $10. 
#crew keeping safety top of mind in CLT. http://t.co/a0YoSJHZMc 
I booked a flight yesterday but didnt receive an email confirmation and I my dividends number isn't registering. Please help. 
will my known traveler no. transfer over from @AmericanAir ? when I check in at t-24 as an AA elite I can get choice seats? 
I left my son's Duke hat on flight #1761 last night. It says "Mason" on the back. Any way of locating it? Thanks in advance! 
any tips on getting a hotel that your airline won't get for any of us even though we were told that we'd make our flight? 
it's not a consolation because my bags are somewhere else, which is a real impediment to me going on a different vacation 
missing my reservations due to a Cancelled Flightled flight. Make it right by giving me first class tomorrow. Make your customers happy. 
issues are not with people who r nice or storm emails with wrong phone numbers auto rebooked flights to non connecting cities 
is there any way that you could hold flight 628 in CLT my husband is stuck in the security check line. flight scheduled for 1PM 
cust serv reps who are unable to change reservations in your system Check in unaware of Cancelled Flights that I got word on night before 
I believe you. But in all seriousness, what's an acceptable time I should have this expense on my name that wasn't my fault.... 
Travelling from pwm to atl on Sunday That flight got Cancelled Flightled and my new flight is Cancelled Flightled and got disconnected when reFlight Booking Problems 
it's be nice to take a flight and have some level of consistency / service from the flight attendants. Quality control??? 
— I had exceptional service on flight #403 from IND to PHX!! 
@AmericanAir what a joke of a company today reminded me why I never book with you 
what is the baggage allowance on flights from Glasgow to the US?  Thanks 
No I missed the funeral so I had to take a train back to Newark 
Don't tell me that. Tell me what I can actually DO to reach someone. I don't mind being put on hold but it won't even do THAT. 
we r rebooked. got conflicting info abt baggage. Y no extra plane batteries on hand? Y no comped admirals club for 9 hr wait? 
Fabulous - thank you so much! Looking forward to taking to the skies with you! :) 
please hogs my next flight for me! I'm waiting on a bus to get me off one plane so I can run to the other. It leaves in two min! 
please hold 3923! I can see it. Just can't get off my first plane quick enough 
No speciifc email. 1500 character limit for complaints. Is AA/US customer complaints adopting the twitter model? 
customer service at its finest 
then why did my whole team be able to put there carry ons under the plane 
and @AmericanAir  4 days of Cancelled Flightations, I have driven to 3 airports in 3 different states, spent more on gas than my flight. 
@AmericanAir  best u could do-I might get my refund within 2 billing cycles. Months of u guys asking for another chance. I'm done 
thank you! I tried that and they said they didn't have it. Anywhere else to try? 
 my flight was #3729...but I left my phone on the plane or the shuttle :( 
this is the aforementioned pilot. @AmericanAir sure you want to merge with these patron hitting hoodlums? http://t.co/C24cEfa9pl 
how is your gate agent gonna tell me my flight is on time when its 5 minutes past departure time and the previous flights plane.. 
I want my money back. Now we're sitting on the runway. After a 2 hour delay, waiting for the baggage to begin loading. 
Haha - that will indeed be a great day! 
you are horrendous.  Pull your shit together 
Absolutely!! The staff was amazing!! 
Flight Booking Problems a flight using credit from a previously Cancelled Flightled flight. Can't get thru on the phone and can't book online. Help please. 
will you please update your website with the most current flight status? And update your customer service phone # on @google thx 
Waiting for my luggage on flight 1923. Is there a delay? 
Darn it, first in line for no upgrade! Wish I understood the policy. :) http://t.co/xGPaAyFDwt 
If I could/wanted to call I wouldn't use the internet to make a reservation.

Site won't work on Chrome, on several computers. 
me too. In the future, have a better harsh weather preparedness plan. So much of your staff called out that everything snowballed 
Thank you so much its been a very stressful day 
I was supposed to be on flight 1861 from Charlotte to RDU @ 8:20pm yesterday. Is the same flight scheduled for departure tonight? 
unfortunately not. I think I watched it take off from the bus. Rebooked for a Late Flightr flight now #planestrainsandautomobiles 
Thks 4 tip. Seems like a workaround rather than a customer-friendly solution. They should have an easily accessible email. 
never in my life have I dealt with such poor customer service, irresponsible staff and lack of care LGA-IAH day 2, baggage in NC? 
@Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense? 
done 
the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number? 
also your employees were LESS then helpful when @Jack_Kairys was checking his bag. Two just left their desks completely (1/2) 
@Jack_Kairys (2/2) and another sent him to the wrong line...oh and the kiosks weren't working! #thanks 
flight 1808 is not leaving at 2:45 because we haven't even begun to board yet. Please update your website ASAP 
charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp; I want 2 reschedule same flight but in July 
on hold for 2 hours. You know what just keep my money 
can you please DM me, my flight has been delayed going into CLT which will force me to miss my connection to LGA at 10:05pm 
you made us miss our flight, first class now I can't even enter the admirals club.  Not happy  dm me to fix this. 
I hope flight 1855 is not being delayed because flight attendant didn't come to work! #nobackup 
we've (flight 4443) been sitting on the tarmac of dca for a while now waiting on a gate. Can we just use another gate? 
please please please let my plane back to the gate so I can get off as I will miss connection due to CLT closing. 2034 
your customer service stinks. Trying to book a flight for hours now and keep getting hung up on. #usairwayssucks 
right on. Up. Up &amp; away ✈️🌞 
I had a rep 10 min in who said she couldn't help so transferred me to dividend miles customer service 
Would love to combine AA and USAir accts. Unfortunately, one has my middle name &amp; one has middle initial. Won't allow change 
If you believe in keeping your customers happy, especially after a mistake was made on your part... 
 Have an agent with reservations contact me instead of asking me to waste my time by sitting on the phone for hours 
@AmericanAir  we are on us/aa flight 4443.We  arrived at dca at 2:12. Waiting on our gate (33)for apx an hr now. No update? 
Thx for responding :) When bags came there was mad rush towards end of jetway—why not just put thru baggage claim? 
thanks Travis at PHL A East checkin for knowing baggage policies. Skis &amp; boots count as 1. Teach your mgr who didn't know 
great job communicating to the passengers! Flight 1855 doesn't exist anymore? http://t.co/hLZaHXkdSn 
after missing my flight and reFlight Booking Problems 2x, I just walked onto another flight and my phone was still on the seat!! 
still can't get a real person on the phone to book a flight. Ready to just go with #jetblue since they care. #usairwayssucks 
And it's 3:22 with no sign of boarding.... Can I please get another update? 
told no gates open at #ORD, needed to wait 20mins. Still waiting after about 4 mins. 
had a horrible experience flying from Montego Bay to Philadelphia on 2/11. $125 2check a golf bag, constant selling in-flight 
2.5 hours Late Flightr and the flight has been Cancelled Flightled. You gotta work on your internal communication skills. 
Yes. Works in Firefox. 

Can do everything but finish purchase. Button turns gray, never submits. For a couple weeks now. 
any updates on flight 5202 from ORF to PHL no one at gate...  ;( 
The airline is embarrassing itself. I get that bad weather isn't your fault, but your response to it couldn't have been worse. 
nice touch with using my first name.  Very intimate.  I'll be filing a claim soon to be reimbursed. Have a us airways day! 
how about a drink voucher for the next flight?? #winkwink 
I just want to get home before Wednesday... Joke is over, 50hrs of Cancelled Flightlations and delays is enough! 
I’m cool with weather delays etc. But lying and deceiving passengers to keep them from changing is reprehensible. #yousuck 
thanks. 😒 
that's why u guys are my #1 choice. 
I just think if I am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight I shouldn't absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight 
 you Cancelled Flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @USAirways #neveragain 
tooooo many Cancelled Flightations! My chain of command hates me now 
Please staff your flights approproately. Our entire flight is delayed because FA isnt here. I shouldnt have left Delta... 
I would be on my way but   wether has delayed yet again.. Love the Charlotte ice storm!!  Good luck with mad customers 
holding 30+ min and listening to your shitty ads on repeat for your credit make me hate your airline even more.  @delta is better 
have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw. 
Sending thanks to employee Freddie in PHL Admiral Club A East for allowing me to give a day pass to my sibling stuck there today. 
was rebooked but sucked big time. Crappy layover. Customer service very sub-par. 
can I get free wifi since the flight 1808 was Cancelled Flightled? 
I don't know I've tried to call for confirmation but calls aren't going thru. Can you let me know? 
I'm traveling around the world until the end of the year. 800 numbers do me no good. 
It was 9º, and some of us had left coats in our luggage in anticipation of cramped overhead bins :| 
I've been on hold for over 2 hours. Need to re-book a flight, please help. 
YOU ARE AMAZING!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE AND I FOLLOW YOU BACK;)🙏🙏🙏✌️😉) 
I have now called 12 times in the last three days. That's unacceptable. I'm willing to wait on hold, but that's not an option. 
conf number FMJTYL delayed - any chance of getting an earlier flight fll to phx? 
I have been rebooked but It has been handled very unprofessionally. Cancelled Flightations happen but the disorganization is uncalled for. 
flight #654 sitting at JFK with delays for 3-1/2 hrs! No employees to load bags? #terrible 
 If you can waive a fee at time of Cancelled Flightation, you CAN WAIVE IT AT A FUTURE DATE! #usairways #ripoff #poorcustomerservice 
YOU ARE THE BEST AIRWAYS! Follow me please!!!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 
Flight Cancelled Flighted because of #Neptune Could not get to my destination. #notmyfault  #waive$200fee #ripoff #poorcustomerservice

no wonder you are the lowest rated airline in america. #shameful #USAirways

Feeling helpless at Tanpa airport. How can I talk to someone. Flight delayed 4 times. Need help. Missed connections will be prob 
YOU ARE AMAZING!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE 🙏🙏🙏😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏 
Thank you. And thanks for being so accommodating.

YOU ARE THE BEST AIRWAYS!!!!!!!!!! FOLLOW ME BACK, PLEASE 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 
stranded @Ernie_Vigil Phoenix w/ broken foot.  Both my flights f'd, Sunday for "sickcrew".  Cancelled Flighted my mechanics flight today. 
I've been on hold for over 90 minutes... There's a lack of quality service here.  Nobody cares that I hate your shitty airline. 
is anyone working today?? Anyone want to pick up a phone? 
if ur going 2 charge $20 for wi-fi make sure it works. #Brutal #DialUp b a 100 by the time things load. #TheEnd #GoodDay 
flight 4524 delayed for 2 hours for a deadhead crew.  Lets make 150 paying customers wait ...that is great service #USAirways 
Flight # 604. Thanks. 
This flight was for my brother. He has been rebooked and I was able to give my info over the phone to get him a pass to the Club. 
I will be traveling from LAX to CLT to HTS, I have been rebooked for tomorrow due to the travel advisory. 
@AmericanAir Your staff members are looking at me like I have two heads. Check your own websites!!! http://t.co/8Hh0c63TIe 
@satesq theres only one flt PHL-CRW per day. 
Frustrating days!No flights home, changed airlines. Thank you PHL USAirway employees &amp; @united for help getting me back to IAH. 
yes I can pay out of pocket that us not helping me for loosing my first class ticket to coach.   I want resolution or a comp 
8 weeks to refund this ticket - 0372389047497?!? - totally unacceptable.  Fix this or I'll put it on blast on social media and TV 
They're all reservations numbers and none are in Hungary. And my phone not working here. You make it too difficult. 
very disappointed I wasn't "allowed" to change seats after checking in early online for a flight tomorrow morning. 
And really, it's a middle initial versus middle name. All else the same. Not spending my time on your computer issues. 
with the weather mess in the South, I missed my connection in CLT. Impressed though with the Cust Serv phone reps today. 
flight 4524  first a 2 hour wait for a deadhead crew  then deadhead crew takes overhead bin space paying customers annoyed 
strikes again. @emilylyonss  I strongly suggest you live tweet your ordeal. Their media team appreciates the updates 😎 
It was US 893. The gate was open after about 50 mins waiting. What a great way to finish an 18 hour delayed arrival!! 
I been on hold with U for 40mins wasting my time and $ &amp; I don't appreciate it #WheresTheCustomerServiceAt http://t.co/phI2IfNjIT 
Total BS... I offered to pay for a full First Class airfare ..Told Sold out.. 3 seats and they gave the seats to others... #crap 
 redeemed themselves!  Flight out at 7:44!!! Had to call and negotiate,  but thank the Lord I'm heading home!!!!! 
2 and a half hours on hold... Hope it feels good to be a steaming pile of shit.  @AmericanAir paid far too much for you. 
I've been waiting for the callback for EIGHT HOURS. HOW MUCH LONGER?! 
thanks 
so i ask for ice and the attendant snaps "i dont have ice on this cart" not 5 min Late Flightr 2 cups of ice to the people 2 rows ahead. 
flt 5302 CLT to DAY supposed to depart 5:51; the 6:20...still no crew. #schedule/contact the pilot! 
Thanks. It would be better from the gate agent at C14 in Charlotte boarding flight 1791. 
3+ hours on hold... oh, wait, for less than 5 minutes a useless CSR talked to me and put me back on hold for the last 30 minutes. 
if I cant get through to reservations how can they take a look? 2+ hour hold times are not reasonable in any industry! 
ticket couldnt be used bc unable to get to departing dest (RSW) bc of blizzard in BOS. Told only way to use credit is $200 fine 
flying high thanks! 
how long is that flight? http://t.co/bCwckWtnlE 
UR service is so shitty. Pilot never showed up so we waited hours because another pilot was supposed to come but didn't #Cancelled Flighted 
HA!  You're fun. 
My Flight Booking Problems C68LD9 just times out when I select it under Manage My Flight Booking Problems for months now. I have emailed but no response. Help? 
thx 4 replying. After trying 2 get thru many times, &amp; v-mail or people hanging up on, us we talked 2 tech...cont'd 
 thank you! Glad to be heading home! Great people at your call center! 
contd.. They put her on 7 pm flite tonite. I think she's on now. Worst customer service ever! U need to fix it. 
Stop reposting same autoresponse  That was return flight home #imateacher. Couldnt get to RSW  #neptune#waivethefee #notmyfault 
Being put back on hold for what has now been an HOUR is completely unacceptable. 
I tried speaking to multiple people at your reservations desk after 30 min on hold. #waivethefee #poorcustomerservice #Neptune 
I was told there is no record of my refund.  Can someone please help me. This has been a long day 
freaking out about the fact you are fixing the engine from Charlotte to Orlando. #longday 
i dont need to check status of my flight because i was ON the plane and you had a door malfunction. Get it together!! 
to @USAirways my trip is all screwed up. Ive had to move meetings and a dinner and im STILL not out of nyc yet 
4 hours... 4 hours... FOUR HOURS.  It's like this is a joke to you. 
been delayed three times now finally boarded. Been waiting 20 minutes. Now being told the plan has to be completely powered down. 
and if the flight is full? 
- I'm in the Cust Svc line.  Your Charlotte, NC agents better be in their A game. 
1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous! 
I did, but it won't help.. Can't believe you wouldn't take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits? 
I have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. I thought I had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. Is that not true? 
Eh, it happens. I think I'll survive. 😉 Thanks! 
Only water on flight 763 to DCA? This is the first time I've ever seen this happen. #ExecutivePlatinumMeansNothing #IWantCoffee 
is the worst airline I’ve ever flown on. You guys have treated me like garbage today. 
thanks for your help! I left a message for DCA lost and found. Fingers crossed we find it! 
I just hope that pilot had a good day off 
I'm on the flight, finally in the air. Not enough food to feed customers. No movie or entertainment on a 5 hr flight. 
flt 470 Tampa to CLT is very Late Flight gonna miss conn to BOS what can you do? 
where's my bag?  You called at noon promising it today, would like an update like your website promises.  I need that bag! 
sits on a throne of lies 
what does "your reservation is 'out of sync.'" mean? On hold w customer service 12 min and want an idea what is up 
flights keep getting delayed and Cancelled Flighted with no information, worst customer service ever. 
stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff. 
bad weather shouldn't mean bad service 
they call weather an act of God and refuse to help. I have my wife and 3 kids and they have no sympathy. 
beware,  Barklays bank has terrible cust service. Will not assist, only know to go by badly written book(in English). 
when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn't care less 
I'm amazed at the lack of communication with the passengers. 
car services to and from the hotel, food, hotel cost bc of Cancelled Flightlations fall on the customer with last minute notifications 
Commitment to excellence is 2b praised. Can get you to the wrong city 2 days Late Flight or the right one 3 days Late Flight. #customerservice 
Thanks to Kevin and team at F38ish at PHL for some great service recovery tonight. Appreciate it. 
My daughter is stranded in charlotte because US Airways Cancelled Flightled her flight tonight.  Completely dissatisfied with @USAirways 
delayed my flight 3 times before Cancelled Flighting it, had angry and rude workers, and are now providing no helpful service at all 
I've been sitting in the Charlotte airport for 4 hours. Waited for crew and now maintenance.  #NeverAgain 
No, they won't because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn't borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours... 
and no one has been at all helpful. I will never fly this airline again. #NeverAgain #spreadtheword 
on hold for 1:23. All because they won't let me use a companion voucher online http://t.co/DPhQRgkdoA 
@erickofiejones how long are billing cycles 
Will do. I appreciate the response. 
Your whole handling of this was a joke.Boston Logan had one little old lady,ONE handling all the customers http://t.co/DH2rfUIJYP 
@noltnancy What will be is a what may be...what is...sucks. #fail 
how about an update? 2hrs delayed, this obviously isnt up 2 date, havent boarded http://t.co/L7lWjaZiOA 
 glad to be home and that your great people got me home safely. Sad for others who didn't get back bc of scheduling problems. 
not too impressed with your airlines but I would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow 
I'm sure you don't but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won't come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks. 
NOT GOOD. been on hold for 1hour (2x/day) since sun. to book 1-way flt dividend miles. agents send me to on hold hell. #furious 
@husainhaqqani Mr. Husain u shld protest as well when one of ur party member Rehman Malik delayed a PIA flight for hours..??? 
thanks! It's hectic for everyone but their actions don't represent the company well IMO 
TYVM USAir, Happy Night@ &lt;3 
a flight update doesn't help when we are waiting 20+ min at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. Who can I write?😑 
me too. Me too. 
hey let flight 1874get to the gate  hours Late Flight and no fate with dozens of kids on board 
Only the JFK baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on Cancelled Flightled flight 3121 to DCA. Shameful. 
 that would be lovely! You have great people working in your organization. 
Thank you! 
Awesome USAir, TYSVM &lt;3 
 really u gave 6 scotch on the rocks to an out of control drunk and would not let my sister change seats when he was grouping her 
Dude named Shaquille at the desk in Charlotte was incredibly professional and helpful vs. some crazy angry people tonight 
Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour 
I'm sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether 
Shout out to the red-headed gate agent for flt 3389 from DCA to CHS at 7:10 tonight. Didn't get her name but she was great! 
flt 4439 is on the ground, but you don't have a gate for us at dca. Why is this happening? 
5 hr flight delay and a delay when we land . Is that even real life ? Get me off this plane , I wanna go home 👠👠👠 (3 heel clicks) 
YOU ARE THE BEST AIRWAYS!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏 
she just did but really how drunk does someone have to be before you stop serving them 
my sister was supposed to leave at 10 am to go back to AL. She's only getting to NC now. Are you kidding me #NeverflyUSairways 👿 
~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn't make up for it 
No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I've landed but was suppose to land at 5 
My flight (US558) got Cancelled Flightled on 2/16 due to lack of flight crew.I was told that I'd be reimbursed for hotel. Who do I contact? 
that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding. 
your saving grace was our flight attendant Dallas who was amazing. wish he would transfer to Delta where I would see him again 
already called, no other options, flight is being reimbursed. Never again, you are unreliable for business travelers. 
Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number. 
on the phone now. looks like global 
half an inch of snow in Charlotte #overwhelming 
I absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in Phoenix. Totally false, was a crew issue. 
of course never again tho . Thanks for tweetin ur concern but not Doin anythin to fix what happened. I'll choose wiser next time 
missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. Yet no voucher on your part? #fail 
traveling with 2 year old. would appreciate you holding up your end of good business and hosting us in our unanticipated layover. 
this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now! 
25 mins after the scheduled departure and still sitting in terminal. Communication would be lovely... http://t.co/pkAxUNYfn2 
thanks. We did see an agent. Unhelpful. Some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons. 
thank you 
disappointment? Making own arrangements for me &amp; my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from USAir is maddening. 
not even on your dime and free tickets.  #worsttraveldayever 
Fuck you 
325 minute delay - this is absurd. Feel free to provide credits... http://t.co/e09keJ9bv1 
“@USAirways: @fispahani Weather disruptions have caused some of our crew to run Late Flight. We're sorry for the delay to your flight.” 
Worst experience ever. Unable 2 help over phone and told at last min cabin crew unavailable for flight. Never again #USAirways 
@AmericanAir stranded in cold Texas and getting sick because you overbooked the flight and gave my seat away. #gooutofbusiness 
my luggage was delayed. I'm looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it... 
I appreciate the hard work. Still, I gave up after &gt;hour. @dsearls 
why didn't you reroute BOS to JAX via DCA through CLT instead forcing an overnight @DCA #passengersLose 
@Forsyth_Factor hope for no weather delays no help to reroute and your on your own for lodging non stop is the way to go 
great but that still does not help me.. 
hi!  Could you protect me on US 445 just in case? Still on ground with no checked luggage, but still a chance I can make original 
after last night in Charlotte NC I'm seriously debating never flying you again. 50 minute on the Tarmac, connection leaves. 
@AmericanAir @SVLLINDIA provides you the best logistics experience for people all over India.
#Mumbai #Surat #NaviMumbai 
u guys get too much $$$ and too many customers  to be fucking up as badly as u do 
lack of communication with other offices, the customer, &amp; yall never update ur systems. U guys are 2 established 4 this mess 
I've been on hold for one hour and four minutes for your reservations line. How can you possibly do business this way? 
I gave up http://t.co/2eDgc6TbLs 
over 4 weeks since you took our money and left us stranded 9 hours from home. Had to rent a car and you still have not helped us 
how about a phone # to talk to a real person? 
 please don't go to the check in process @AmericanAir uses at #MCO. It's an absolute disaster. 
YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏 
1st a reaccommodation, now a delayed flight for this one.  &amp; the Gate Agent still hasn't mumbled a word. Folks getting anxious. 
Thx to gate agt John Pascucci for finding us a flight from CLT to PVD after our original one was Cancelled Flightled http://t.co/YiwLhQhZgp 
5534. That's the flight I was placed on after original flight to Charlotte was Cancelled Flightled.  Now 5534 is on 1hr delay 
gate agents are now working with everyone to resolve connecting flight issues which is my concern 
@SDFAirport  I really needed to be back home yesterday and at work at 9am today. Been on plane and sitting for an hour #peeved 
tell them to get on that, please. 
I totally understand the weather. Just frustrated. Thanks! 
we are boarding now but have yet to depart.  Thanks for the response. 
You all work hard at making sure things flow smoothly. Keeping positive. 
Has the most useless &amp; Rude employees ever at Philadelphia airport never again will I fly with them ! 😤 
stuck in cae need reFlight Booking Problems for next flight possibly dm for more info 
Thanks means a lot after I was verbally cussed out, charged extra for a bag, &amp; then told " I don't feel like dealing with it" 😒 
grades for this trip:

Flight timeliness: 👎✈️
Cancelled Flightations: 👎😬
Customer Service: 👎😡
Flight attendants: 😊👏 
if there are empty first class seats on my flight at check in, why wouldn't I be automatically upgraded? 
@BohnJai they lost my bag @PHL baggage handlers broke open my bag and stole my camera 
tell the flight from clt to srq 5080 to wait!!!!!! 
what do I push to rebook with that 800 number 
#usairways #unacceptable #holdtime REALLY?! http://t.co/UPp41AbxrQ 
Trying to go Nashville to London and just have no idea when would be a good time to fly out of Nashville right now. @AmericanAir 
still not in the air for deicing of plane. I'll miss connect but customer service was helpful.I'm hoping to catch the next flight 
why aren't twitter and reservations connected? What do people want? Reservations, duh?!?! 
tell reservations to rebook me from 5080 to 5129 
last name Pordes 
I just checked in online for tomorrow's flight - thought I should get auto upgrade? (Already got the email saying no seats) 
what is policy on changing flight to different dates once your flight has been delayed? 
I've called for 3 days and can't get thru. is there some secret method i can use that doesn't result in you hanging up on me? 
now over 2 hrs. Can't wait anymore. 2 hrs for nothing. Now what?? #frustrated #USAirways http://t.co/BuwjTVUWKM 
so you're going to make me wait that long on the phone line when you can help me? # that's part of the problem 
this is got to be the worst service I've ever seen with an airline. 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. Currently flight delayed 
that is the most useless tweet I've ever seen out of you. 
How long does it take to receive ticket # from @AmericanAir for itin booked via http://t.co/79waJk7EyT on US flights? 
we're all standing here and no one is saying anything. I'll most likely be missing my flight to BWI AGAIN. http://t.co/JhaU4K48yv 
what are the odds you can get me on a flight with delta so I can actually get to Orlando today?? #2daysLate Flight 
No reFlight Booking Problems necessary. I can't afford to deal this kind of unprofessionalism again. I would, however, like some type of credit. 
I don't need to rebook I need to know the policy 
Credit to my bank account for the two days of work that I've missed because of these Cancelled Flightlations. 
my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from USAirways. I will never use them again or refer anyone! 
2nd time this occurred in 3 weeks. I'm not patient. I have no choice.  #Antitrust issue 
so the seat next to me (19B) on flight 1943 to Seattle has a tray table that is falling off... http://t.co/HAJ5lKqjW4 
YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏 
has an SPF record error that is causing e-mail from noreply@usairwaysmobile.com to go to spam filters. DNS admin needs to fix! 
still can't get through and travel in 2 days. #ridiculous #donthavehighhopes 
we might need a plane to get somewhere but just remember that you aren't the only choice #makeovertime#customerserviceplease 
I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight a months ago I used my old license do I need to change that? 
little help to us! My husband has been on hold for an hour for something that take 5 minutes to complete. 
No, this is a systemic problem. Mail comes from 153.69.214.203 but USAirways SPF record disallows it. DM me for more detail 
I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight months ago I used my old license do I need to change that? 
thanks so much! 
any word on flight 1748 getting out of DFW in the near future? Stuck on plane at gate for over an hour 
will never travel with you again. This is insanity. storms are inevitable but making us hold to just add a lap child #badservice 
for a response in 3-4 days? No thanks 

This is how vacations get Cancelled Flightled been on hold ⤵for 40+ minutes still havent talked to anyone. #failure http://t.co/ef4P0HISHb 
is useless airways. Day 2 trying to get home on standby as a result of their Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways 
I've been on hold with your Divident Miles service desk for 45 minutes, and that's after being hung up on the first time. 
YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME BACK, PLEASE!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 
Hey! I booked a flight (Isabelle Gramp, Boston to LAX), and it said that it charged my credit card but the transaction didn't go 
through, can you confirm that I haven't been charged? 
thanks for crappy hotel with no food and a taxi bill followed by being on standby for your Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways 
thanks :) 

Not one to complain much but really 1 hour 15minutes and still nothing. Agents or Agent ⤵ http://t.co/Q5SB0DaVuy 
@AmericanAir 90 min delay thanks to "maintenance issues". Thanks for wasting a day. 
My flight was delayed and rerouted, and not so much as a "sorry for your inconvenience" from the check-in agent? #notimpressed 
Thank you, busy times. 
I hope so. Last I spoke to the baggage team... they weren't sure what city my bag was in. 
So we got her home, now we just need her bag. Is there a direct desk number for Savannah? 
flight is delayed 5 hours. No reason given. Sure love flying with your airline. #whatajoke 
Is there a way to have someone contact me when you have an agent available? Need help Flight Booking Problems an award flight. 
Does your company see passengers as customers or just $$$? 
just realized my @AmericanAir advantage number wasn't used for my flight.  How do I get my ff miles? 
announced that people going to FL via Charlotte would have to go to a different plane &amp; gate, but it was a 'direct flight' #logic 
2 days in a row I call and still can't get anyone on the phone. Do you actually have any employees? 
new tag line "but we got you there alive!" 
flight today showing on time online, not able to check in. Called &amp; told was Cancelled Flightled, put on hold over an hr ago. Help? 
Thank you. But it is sad that she couldn't talk 2 a REAL person &amp; kept getting disconnected by an automated msg. 
where's my apology? 
Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies. 
I've been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really?  A global company?  Help! 
2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can't even fix it. Worst service I've ever had 
Why not have an option for a call back? I'm just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed. 
I've been trying for DAYS!  And I don't get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts.  What am I to do?? 
you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... I was living in an airport, you offered no monetary assistance! 
can I get assistance on flight #611? Plane just landed from HPN and I have a connection to ATL. 
this is crazy. Haven't spoken to a human yet. There has to be a better way. http://t.co/mEOAlCIPdD 
 last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged.   No one answers the baggage call line for status?  #chairmanlove 
why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have  a connection? 
1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways . 
Would you guys please send service agents to gate B15 in Philly?  All the people missed there connections and there's only 2. 
how do you give stand by seats to ticketed passengers who you know have a connecting flight ? 
Thank you!!! On our way to get her bag now - thanks to having that number 😊 
thanks for seating me next to 2 hot athletes. This flight is significantly better now! 
link doesn't work and I've tried tracking my bag several times. Still doesn't clarify where it is. 
yes and our flight attendant (who is wonderful btw) secured the tray table so it's not flailing about. http://t.co/JhXWMuTx4G 
On hold for an hour...connected to the wrong department by your automated system...transferred and now another 45 min &amp; counting 
stranded in Philly- #Starving and can't get a meal voucher even though your plane had mechanical issue /  next flight in 10 hrs 
thanks for reaching out to me.  My Gold Div no. 2k424j0. My Flights were changed under Confirmation # DNX58V. 
Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I'm still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up 
that link is broken. But if it's the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information. 
must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself 
It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request 
they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy? 
no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho 
your agent did not say 
not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41. 
do families no longer get early boarding with young kids?  American, your new parent, gives it to us... 
There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending. 

Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'? 
yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through. 
Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week 
I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options 
I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway 
why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process? 
That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks. 
I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food! 
I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck 
that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again 
would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible 
YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏 
booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone? 
would you consider honoring the original fare price if I were to try Flight Booking Problems the ticket again? 
I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase. 
Is it possible to earn Dividend Miles for a passenger that is not me, even if I am purchasing the tickets? 
Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!! 
@USAirways we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! http://t.co/7STktJXAN1 (although we're not sure what a timbit is...) 
she also appreciated having her very own hashtag! :) #lucycat 
Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks 
my number is 214-725-1966.  CANT WAIT...LOL #usairsucks 
thanks! 
the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is "I don't really know what happened" 
I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck 
a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all. 
would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold? 
would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire 
would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation? 
would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold? 
the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone. 
nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain 
thanks!  Can you help remind the agents it's ok?  Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing 
really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks 
so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks 
40 minutes to put my TSA number in… 40 mins… and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa 
but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma 
turns into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why 
that wasn’t my Q but thanks. Wondering why you’re the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0 
I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting. 
I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges 
Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer. 
so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher 
the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do? 
I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport 
Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off. 
only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage 
I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service 
I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend 
I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight 
is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person. 
I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !! 
Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online 
you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared. 
No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease 
What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking? 
had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again 
strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst 
stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville 
surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks! 
@DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard 
how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks 
I realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting Cancelled Flighted. Please prioritize ur passengers and help them 
I have a flight in Saturday from MCI to CLT and there's heavy snow predicted in MCI. When will u allow for changes? 
thanks to Betty working gate at ILM and lovely gate agents here in CLT helping me get home 2 Phx tonight instead of tomorrow 
You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again... 
thanks. 
I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering. 
@FAANews how can I be stuck on a plane due to snow in Boston when it's not actually snowing in Boston?  Usair flight 2218 #US2218 
thanks for giving away my seat. Another fine job! http://t.co/r7ibqr4CYd 
your pple did a great job w the madness however some of your systems need help. I appreciate the hard work &amp; the push to b better 
you see now that is a lie.  They auto respond with insulting email. #sucks 
I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don't care 
us2118
My wife in Boston says no snow right now. 
started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck 
@AmericanAir First Class all the way!!💺✈️ Headed to @portlandjetport http://t.co/kDMq0jps02 
no they dont.  I think I already said that.  No one responds.  Its an auto response.  Wait is this an auto response?????? 
Looking forward to some friends and family time in Arizona. 
my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday and moved to today, then while at my stop in DC my flight is delayed due to lack of crew US4485 
this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew? 
ok thank you we were told ground delay due to snow. 
I paid for my ticket on @PayPal on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account. 
to CLT from JFK nasty planes, dirty seats &amp; floors, rude flight attendants- hopefully AA can get you cleaned up #disgusting #vile 
"admirals club" at CLT has rude, and ignorant front desk staff...@AmericanAir you have fallen so far...THANKS DOUG PARKER!!! 
Thanks. Suggestion: stop the promo messages after a bit and just run music &amp; a msg that says "call volume is high." #vrm 
#USAirways So my flight was Late Flight getting into charlotte so i miss my connector to Phoenix thanks again last time I EVER FLY USAIR 
your app sucks balls compared to @AmericanAir 
Thanks for showing interest...3880 to Greenville, SC. 
we haven't departed yet so let's not get too high hopes.  But everything has been on schedule so far 
 thanks! Now I just need to locate where my luggage is! 
that's understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate 
after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic 
...these changes as well to Late Flightr find out that the flight I was scheduled for isn't ready 
well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks 
it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys 
Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided. 
Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don't lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v 
Marsha M. at Myrtle Beach is the greatest! She deserves all the respect and praise there is! #ThankYouForEverything 
 I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out 
just lost a faithful customer. 
My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed. 
@MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you "hope" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you. 
we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool 
I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good 
the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong 
once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks 
PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL 
I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly. 
Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member. 
I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please  pass along my feedback. I've tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :( 
my TSA precheck isn't showing up on my boarding pass for my flight tomorrow...help!? #USAirways #TSAPreCheck 
 sitting on Tarmac in #PIT for 30 min. No announcement. Just sitting. 
Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us? 
Finally back on board.  Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier 
@AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.” Confirmation code? 
you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA 
if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now. 
I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off. 
Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs. 
I'm sorry as well. It's been 24 hrs without my bag and I can't get a straight answers. I'm on call #6 for today. 
The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good. 
what's going on? I've been hearing a not-friendly 'Please wait' on repeat while I'm on hold, being transferred to idk where... 
I got an email asking me to checkin TMRW for a flight I meant to book for 3/19 - can someone please help! @WallStSlumLord @PKG49 
Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double. 
so far I've gotten six different answers 
I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight? 
...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa. 
Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere. 
delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone 
@AmericanAir hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit? 
is there nothing that can be done online to help? i bought these as a birthday present, just trying to be able to afford a change 
It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen. 
Your software is broken. "Call Customer Support" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers. 
now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!! 
shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout 
ice cream up front! Solid 
being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here 
why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr 
I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX. 
you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done 
on time today and from PHL! Nice work! #ThereIsAFirstForEverything 
so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee? 
finally rectified my flight situation! Thanks again 
is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa. 
still waiting! Captain reports he's called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr 
yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE 
I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! @AllegiantTravel does not! help! 
Emailed them a week ago and still nothing... 
attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details.  Called twice and disconnected. 
it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far 
well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA 
on Sunday! Can't wait! See you then 
delays to the max 
you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient. 
can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth 
landed safely everything worked out. 
4 flights in 48hrs &amp; I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :) 
please follow me so I can DM you about something 
this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. http://t.co/N7pSuEJDC8 
yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing 
thank you for fixing my 5 hour delay. 
My wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails Is it possible usair Cancelled Flightled 
no your not! 
been on hold for over an hour, still don't know where my bags are, won't refund me my flight?!?! It wasn't weather!! 
My flight finally arrived in Charlotte.  They booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me.  What a mess 
how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at Reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to Cincy is delayed trying to find her 
really!?? 
: i have been trying to reach dividend miles  to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back 
: its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help 
Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation 
really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?! 
I found a flight I want on @CheapOair. Is my @AmericanAir AA Advantage # applicable to earn miles on it since you're merging? 
lost our luggage. #yay 
@AmericanAir 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported. 
will I get the full amount credited to my account for US Airways credit? 
#flight4592 LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!!  please go to a gate.  This is absurd. 
sitting for 30 minutes on the runway at dca, because your gates are full? Early landing, Late Flight flight. 
I didn't take my original flight. I was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. Didn't get in til 5 
@AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM your confirmation code so we can forward your kind words.” sent 
3 delays 2 Cancelled Flightlations a double layover and 72 hours Late Flightr....could I at least get extra dividend miles? 
I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min 
got through on the phone. usair Cancelled Flightled her return flights because she missed a flight on her way out. they took care of it 
any plans to support #ApplePay on board? I have the USAirways MC and it would be nice to still use it if I forget the card. 
worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail 
just noticed that I don't believe I saw a confirmation for a flight I bought a few weeks ago. Def paid though. #help #resend? 
captain on flight 1712 from PHX-PHL at 3:55 tonight was hilarious. "Greetings from the pointy end of the airplane" haha thanks! 
: i was told my ticket expired but  i never recvd any notice  before it expired .This sucks.i paid 40k miles &amp; $125 for the tckt 
- done :) 
I didn't Cancelled Flight my flight, you did. Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags 
thank you. We filled out a claim and hope to have the bags tomorrow. 
Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @AmericanAir merger. #USAirways 
Will do :) 
Been dealing w/ @americanair to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. #NotEvenJV 
I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn't have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help 
no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself 
thank you.3860 to cincy.just landed.you should add frequent flyer miles to my account..  a long, incredibly frustrating day 
flying from Manchester international to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights.. 
testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am 
this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service 
if I paid for ticket with advantage world executive card, do I pay baggage fees when flying us airways? Wife traveling now 
I received a brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged...baggage included 
cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating. 
new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can't get through TSA 
checked in last night @ airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1A - boarding today seat changed to 7F. How does that happen? 
you're the only airline that's not open sooner. It's not a confidence booster. 
can they change to correct last name? Did via reservations already but said can't change ticket name.. 
Empty 1st class, Chairman can't move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again! 
the gate agent said "it's booked in full. Sorry" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land. 
so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff 
if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse?  #nothappy 
I paid for my seat.  I expect to be able to use my full seat 
understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem 
it is the same passenger, just her maiden name ended up as last name through online Flight Booking Problems.  Yes, understand non transferable 
i hate you 
btw, not upset at usaiways, promise. 
plz plz plz hold 4438 to EYW. The 810 PHL &gt;CLT is sooo Late Flight. Gonna miss the connection for @jabevan221 's 40th #GTH239 
I'm delayed in TYS #5015, likely gonna miss my connection in CLT to CUN. Gotta get there today. Can you help me? 
just called reservations.  Cannot change just able to put note on res.  Problem is tsa... 
res went under her maiden name...married 50...no docs with maiden name.  Hence, problem. 
good ideas...she is traveling today...at airport.  Need to petition faa regarding silly 24 name change rule. 
'preciate it but cant get off plane to speak w agent / wont come on plane 5015 knoxville...? 
lol thanks to you we had to switch to American http://t.co/Sl6BDRXfN8 
my wife is trying to check in for a flight tonight out of RSW...website not allowing, saying must go to airport... [Part 1 of 2] 
[Part 2 of 2] she tried calling cust serv and the system hung up and her. Twice. Are you having system issues? Please advise. 
OK she is worried that something is wrong with the flight - #1870 - and should she consider flying earlier 
Flight US 723 from @DublinAirport to @PHLAirport passing over @LoveLoughNeagh at 20,000 ft this morning. http://t.co/FRd0cAy6DA 
hey just letting you know you're the worst fucking service I've ever used thanks for nothing 
on flight # 556 delayed#connection help for flight # 561 # help via email 
any chance of making #561? 
I thought about moving a lot of business over too, but first impressions count.. Glad it was miles and not cash. 
@HirasmusBidragi will try.. Now stuck on tarmac waiting on gate. :( may miss 9:25 connection #883) 
I do to as I have an afternoon Conference in Las Vegas and I would rather plan ahead than run thru the airport and then attempt 
let's say it's directly correLate Flightd to the chance of a replacement case. I know which would cost the airline less! 
KUDOS to your phone support and Charlotte gate staff! 
phone support rebooked but orig flt was Late Flight. Made it! 
My booked seat ended up being the last row which was labeled "do no occupy" had to play musical chairs for 30 mins. Unacceptable 
they had to turn the seat cushions over and clean the area. Please explain this issue? 
thanks for slowing the inbound plane down so that we didn't need to worry about 4438 EYW being Late Flight. Great holz ahead. Cheers! 😀 
that's it?!?!? 
our hold up now is the captain that was Late Flight...his bag doesn't fit. 
I'm trying to merge my freq flyer accts but keep getting an error message and only a machine when calling the # provided. Help! 
502 M-phx Im still on The plane waiting And waiting 
wish i was flying @USAirways ... @JetBlue Cancelled Flightled our flights tomorrow and never notified us #FlyUS #Ripoff 
yeah , I have been expecting The same for 3 hours 
1917. Thanks for the 5 hour layover in LA too👍 Icing on the cake. At least your staff was courteous and helpful.. Not #unreal 
I've been on hold for 40 minutes just to get a receipt. I know you guys are busy but I think it's time to higher more staff! 
@AmericanAir I'm a chairman who was in 1st class on both my flights today. System Cancelled Flightled my tickets and kicked me out of 1st. 
can we hold two seats for 11:35 flight from PHX to Las 1856 as this delayed flight 556 is not going to arrive on-time 
we on on the flight from phf to clt. At the terminal but can't get off plane yet. Need to get on iah flight. 
found great prices thru US Air for honeymoon. Website wont work and been on hold for more than a hour now after being told 10 min 
never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone. 
skys r sunny air is cold I can't wait to get to #CLT 
of course! "Yeah, travel has gotten harder. Ask other passengers if they will switch" it's not the fact, it's the attitude! 
another bad experience today.  Frozen pipes on 597.  Missing connection. 
thank you 
😂. Passed frustrated 4 hours ago after being asked to get off the first plane I sat on for an hour. 
left us. had to stay on other flight until they got bags off. This sucks. Had to run with a baby and bags! 
 will be stuck in PHX overnight.  Service is getting worse.  Flying southwest from now on. 
what's happening with 1217 Phl to LAX? Now 3 hr delay. Poor communication! 
thank you for refunding my bag fee.  I look forward to its return today I hope. 
will these prices be honored? Ive waited this 1 1/2 hours on hold to make sure I can still get the prices I originally started 
any updates on flight 1917 from Philly to LA?  Been sitting at gate for close to 2 hours 
on the DL, send Ethan some new pants and some "white revive" laundry tabs. He's a great guy, good crew, he's just, err, single. 
@CakeNDeath Question is will he and his lady behave... 
if you've got room on an earlier flight home, why charge me $75 to get on it? Be the hero! 
got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated 
what's the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight? 
#tbt every day. 
if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that'd be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings. 
How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often... 
sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue? 
657. My daughter Candice and I are together with her baby. 
flight was full.  1 open middle seat.  Did not want to sit there.  What is your policy? 
I've been on a music hold for over a hour trying to get my AAdvantage membership merged, can someone please call me ASAP? 
that's where we are now. Thank you. 
On phone hold for 30+ mins trying to speak to an agent. Can't change reservation online. Sigh. #badcustomerexperience 
Was just on hold with you all for TWO HOURS and then got hung up on. oh my god. 
 Lilly M in SJU check in is fabulous! 
1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled. 
 I have a party of 4 booked for a flight in Aug. At 10:05am, how can I find out how much it would cost to change to an earlier fl 
I've been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful 
is this accurate? Safety guide shown no MP3 player usage during takeoff and landing. http://t.co/Nvk3IrG4KP 
- so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?! 
I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. 
http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn 
#success made flight , please thank the crew of 556 great time recovery 
@AmericanAir no, don't leave me!!! 
they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all. 
I've called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP. 
@AmericanAir for frequent flyer miles can we schedule interchangeably and get credit? 
just so you know who to complain to ;-) RT @USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we’ll be tweeting from @AmericanAir. 
thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You're an inferior airline. 
Reminder: From 2/28, we’ll be tweeting from @AmericanAir. You should join us: http://t.co/WBMHRl3bvl 
thanks 
I'll sincerely regret Dividend miles! Good things coming to an end :( 
Stuck in Philadelphia airport for 32 hours due to "maintenance". Dreading my flight back home. Disgusting. 
END: RT @USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we’ll be tweeting from @AmericanAir. You should join us: http://t.co/NBpCJCpEW9 
what an amazing day. Delayed 4 hrs bc frozen h2o on plane Now sitting @ gate on same plane 4 30 mins still waiting! #flight1797 
Reminder: From 2/28, we’ll be tweeting from @AmericanAir.  http://t.co/mFMNKmvOTR”RT I look 4ward to that follow back too! 
there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!! 
@americanair I feel sorry for AA 
some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative 
now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck! 
can you DM me &amp; add me to the upgrade list for a flt tonight? 
over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter 
No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable. 
@OBJ_3 even airlines are scheming to get a follow from OBJ LMAOOO 😂😂😂😂 
My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with @united and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times... 
was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y'all merged? 
a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its 
Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy. 
yes travel is complete flight 5095 from CLT to CAK Feb 18 
no problem...just funny have a nice day 
1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people @AmericanAir exec bene's not honored 
we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane. 
understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight. 
@AmericanAir been with US Airways since 03,  back and forth Gatwick - Charlotte, then LHR. Bit sad nostalgic way. 
5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService 
@AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will. 
has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible 
You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home. 
yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting 
Only for one flight, though. The 2nd leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft. 
is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @AmericanAir I hope you can fix it 
Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well? 
Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning. 
your app is bad, and you should feel bad. 
worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice 
but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes 
Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed. 
flight 1783 CLT to BOS 
I just think it's weird to have mileage as 666 
thanks to the gate agent in State College, PA that was able to get me on an earlier flight AND figure out an earlier connection! 
a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby? 
@AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better. 
oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat 
How will I change it? 
so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers 
- who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can't be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website. 
still waiting on a response 
lol me too 
I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt? 
@alan_bledsoe Thanks for your feedback, Alan.” Thx, but  no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt 
still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please 
US airways csr at Phoenix airport fixed the problem 
I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone. 
@garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more 
wanted to connect to discuss sponsorship opportunities with http://t.co/q6Xedzvhh9, silicon valleys only 10 day film festival 
how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :( 
I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport 
not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted 
WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS. 
why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps 
is there  anyway to get rebook in help on twitter? 
$75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility 
FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND 
Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew! 
forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay. 
please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ 
yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something 
thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw 
- love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix, 
over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member. 
just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates 
4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection 😡 
I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full. 
25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there. 
4420 delayed further? 
this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything. 
what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight? 
tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers 
they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today 
thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S 
would like to see you do similar in PHL! http://t.co/n9vGe2nPIB 
can I bring a copy or photo of my baby's birth certificate for the flight? I feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing. 
yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you! 
do you post travel alerts on your website? Traveling to Bdl on Sunday morning. 
Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ? 
should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame.. 
i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues 
please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits. 
any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or... 
no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks! 
@AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart. 
pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether 
@AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!! 
http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam? 
I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I’ve been on flight 1776 from BOS —&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat 
flight 437 PHX&gt;ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-( 
flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now 
 your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500. 
platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow? 
never fails to disappoint. 
45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status. 
we got our bags today. Thanks! 
Have a 6:05pm flight out of PHL Sat, 2/21. Snow expected. Are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty? 
thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful. 
HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE 
Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :) 
@AskPayPal So I contacted my bank. They took the money out today. I also contacted @USAirways they said my reservation is 
@AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say "in progress" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th. 
@AskPayPal When will it be marked "completed". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded. 
flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave! 
still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!! 
problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight 
thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to NOLA tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there! 
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ 
I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days. 
unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost 
45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways 
 #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie 
I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE. 
thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway 
Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF 
No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS 
Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer 
I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman 
I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do? 
42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed. 
I already HAVE, four times 
flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives??? 
Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over! 
We're having 2 grandbabies in 2 weeks -- will travel to DC for the births. Thank you for the reasonable fares!  See you Saturday! 
thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa 
FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team! 
ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded. 
but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really? 
we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home. 
due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help! 
1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service?? 
the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed! 
you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused. 
sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect. 
- BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs 
Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment. 
yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting 
even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed 
the flight that I did not connect to was 1857. 
Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection… Help! 
my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta 
never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays. 
that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge. 
oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful 
I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket. 
- I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you. 
DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour! 
They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway? 
doesn't want me to get home 
we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary. 
3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up? 
why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket? 
I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice. 
please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!! 
now the freezing bus is just doing circles? 
worst experience ever with you guys…see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better. 
your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks 
I’ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/ 
the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to "choose" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors 
and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons. 
Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !! 
that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice 
that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us 
I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. 👌 
that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA 
still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up? 
@jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?” Spring Break !!! 
offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!! 
why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable. 
Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes 
Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience. 
I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad 
unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time. 
I am following you now 
we will...sunday! Just a few days away 
Mobile boarding pass email. 
never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service. 
it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical. 
been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience! 
this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated 
7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more! 
I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm. 
NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni 
@AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN. 
thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight. 
thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it 
on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!! 
@AmericanAir I'm in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo! 
gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston 
can you help me reroute my trip? 
I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human. 
today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL. 
is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections. 
is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue. 
1826 trying to make a connection to Punta Cana leave PHL at 9:50 
"Able"? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead? 
#428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo 
you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else 
First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off 
Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard 
we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class. 
yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today. 
ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that???? 
Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH 
hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days 
is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off. 
this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air 
I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight. 
Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super. 
is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half. 
 nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay. 
of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ⛄️☀️ 
the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open. 
we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight. 
this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous 
doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail 
I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable 
well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on. 
nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice 
I appreciate your prompt response. 
He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout 
why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate 
that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service 
need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours! 
thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing! 
You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again. 
And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless. 
has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday! 
app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless. 
it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here 
what is the damn delay???? 
now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible. 
are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2 
now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal. 
big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.  #outstanding #service &amp; #support. 
thanks for helping with #reFlight Booking Problems #Cancelled Flightedflight Yvonne Anthony.  You will help us get to Tel Aviv on time.  #HappyFriday 
I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it 
@AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?! 
No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated." 
835, fix this ASAP 
suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route. 
call Gate D9 in CLT and get me on this flight 
yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing 
Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for "maintenance" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me. 
I've been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! @AmericanAir http://t.co/jasKYPLWt5 
made it.. Never ran so fast in my life 
Done 
sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection 
never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed. 
your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless 
I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster 
the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday 
Thank you for valuing my feedback. What will you do with it? 
I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back # 
5223 out of Gainesville, FL 
made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!! 
headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more). 
Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased. 
I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made 
now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI! 
I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter 
how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707? 
Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares? 
has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal! 
Thank you. But I don’t understand. What will you do with my feedback? 
I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!? 
can I book using some sort of breavement program? I need to get home for my pops funeral 
is a joke. Stop losing my luggage! 
get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps. 
Reservation agent on the phone did a great job. 
can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx 
Thank you 
We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on???? 
2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA. 
isn't it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #NotImpressed 
what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fiancée are stuck in BOS! 
same here! On hold for an hour &amp; then told @USAirways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight 
Cancelled Flightled flight, 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. You could've handed this one better. http://t.co/By3vDioSUA 
delayed I'm charlotte big surprise 
Yes, I get that. I’m asking: Specifically, what will you do with the feedback I’ve given you? 
I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I've since learned @Delta had one! 
thank you! 
horrible experience to key west lost luggage called to check &amp; was told not to call back reconsidering my flight back 
-not just this trip, been a few. Ur saving grace is ur cheaper flights. Now willing to pay more 4 bttr service on bttr airlines. 
and now that flight pushed back to 2:35pm departure. 
thanks is there a beareavement discount anymore or not should I just book online 
don't bother wasting your time!  @USAirways will send u a form letter &amp; let u choose a gift certificate. #worstcustomerservice 

Good news, we got fixed. 
Best GAgent in a long time - Danny B. for US628 DFW-CLT. Appreciated how up to date he kept us during irrops. Super professional! 
the two women workng PHL bag check term C @ 11:30 ET should be fired for being rude, pushy and treating customers with disrespect 
Melinda in reservations in greensboro nc is an absolute jewel thank her for me she's amazing!!! 
no you not sorry. I am trying 2 add a day 2 my vacation but there is a $200 charge just 2 change flights 
Literally all that says is "Case open"  What good is that to me? 
I just want to find my bag so I won't have to go through the hassle of trying to claim what was in my suitcase #usairwaysfail 
was on hold for about 45 minutes after speaking 2 lady at the airport counter. Gave up 
that website does not give correct info said my bag was in Miami was in key west the entire time..I got the run around for 2 days 
awesome! And yes, @UpInAirClaire is! 
I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it. 
how can i get ahold of a reservations supervisor? 
Will you guys be offering no-fee changes for flights out of DCA tomorrow afternoon? 
I'm glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available. 
Thanks. No DC yet, I see. I will keep that link and check back. Appreciate it! 
what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board? 
Nice try.  Doesn't apply to Philly. 
Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice 
your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag. 
can I bring mini bottles of booze on to my flight? 
yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service 
@AmericanAir How do I merge my miles accounts? Your sites tell me my info don't match even though I can't find a difference. 
trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow.  Tried computer, tablet, and phone.  got error message on all devices? 
Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service. 
yes but lost a whole day.  Frustrating!!  #poor customer service 
oh they saw it and said nothing. 
Welcome to North Texas US Air / American Air employees. 
Housing and Education are great opportunities in The GR8 State Of Texas 
will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations instead of just charlotte and atlanta 
i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. Thank you 
Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me? 
flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking 
awesome! Flight #676 out of philly on Tuesday. Party in row 15 if you're interested. 
waiting for bags now over 25min in Phl bag claim! 
we have seats.  on phone Iwas  told I was getting error msg due to paid 1st class upgrd. told to check in after 12am.sound right? 
how do I get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? I don't care how many points he has! He only has 
@AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers 
I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you! 
It wasn't weather this morning.  AWE1701 diverted back to BOS due to mechanical issues.  So far lost one of 3 days :( 
absolutely 
We're sincerely sorry, Sean. Reservations is working hard to answer everyone's call and we appreciate your patience.” #false 
see? No response? Obviously you think this "service" is acceptable. #customerservicefail 
worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it's "not worth it" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS 
me and my wife will be flying out of atlanta to vegas on March 7th since couldn't get any out of tricities here in Tn 
it's vegas baby who doesn't have a good time in vegas lol 
gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans. 
I've tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and I keep getting told to call back. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME 
Know what I like about gate 35X @NationalAirpor ? Nothin.I like nothin bout yo #ghettofab gate #USAirways http://t.co/mAqw2nLNiU 
sure did. I have carried this bag on numerous times on the same style plane. Planning accordingly apparently accounts for nothing 
fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I'm stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009. Solution needed. 
I am just trying to establish what your policy is. Thanks! 
  Just talked to reservation. Must congratulation to them. Very friendly.  Good for usair. The ONLY airline we fly. 
and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what? 
#2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door! 
Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer. 
I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, &amp; it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed 
&amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail 
sure, just DM'ed you. 
Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed! 
- Check-in staff at PHX are awesome! Great traffic control for general boarding. 
I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer. 
right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm. 
will shall see in the next couple of minutes. 
yep, sent my bag to Philadelphia instead of Miami...I caught it...then was told my flight changed to tomorrow, wrong again #fail 
it's painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA 
look! Another apology. DO NOT FLY @USAirways 
another squashed flight. Having to share my seat with another passenger is not@my idea of quality travel 
have scheduled flight Sat(2morrow) CHO-CLT CHO needs to be added to weather advisory.  Please evaluate asap. 
Shavon at customer service desk in Charlotte was fantastic! So helpful and smiling evn after what sounds like long day.Reward her 
followed! 
Please hold US1765 for me. Need to get home tonight before weather. Almost there. 
can u tell me if 5238 from clt to Jan has gotten out of the gate yet?  I will have a tight connection out of clt to mco. 
hi there I am flying MYR-CLT-ORD tomorrow is weather looking ok or problematic? 
have checked all day.  CHO needs added.  Please evaluate. 
if I have Dividend Miles credit card &amp; I used it to book my flight is one bag free? 
That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me? 
look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX 
I'm enjoying my flights so far! You're doing a great job. Today's been tough, so thanks for making my flights comfortable. 
more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing. 
who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay? 
I keep calling your help line (800) 428-4322 and it keeps saying they are too busy to help &amp; to call back Late Flightr. FOR A WEEK NOW! 
since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I'm confused since we had sunny skies 
Yes, it was Sunday. 
this is ridiculous #planebroken can't wait to board this one home 5 hours Late Flightr #neverontime #brutal #paymytab 
why I can't book a flight to PRN through your website? 
Yes thank you. Appreciate u checking... 
any chance of a travel advisory or DCA this weekend? 
@AmericanAir who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line #yousuck 
How do I get through? 
I'm not a frequent flyer with US airways, I'm qantas? Can I still get notifications? Thank you 
Wishing we had our luggage. 2 days now. Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up. 
link didn't work via Mobil. 
Used 2 get emails 1) pre-purchase a snack and 2) when time to check in. Got neither 4 tomorrow's trip. Do they not get sent now? 
how about checking the plane before having everyone board the plane? #pissed 
flight 413 my carryon is missing.stollen off plane or left at gate. Worst customer service. Doesn't seem to be anyone's concern. 
I'm trying to Request Missed Mileage and it keeps saying it can't my flight from 2/13. Then it says call the number. 
there is a travel advis for nyc and phil PA  -winter weather- but U.S. Air hasn't posted one yet. Can I still change flt wo pen? 
it insulting that @USAirways @AmericanAir offer a "non required $50 voucher as a goodwill offering..At least my bag can fly round trip 
@AmericanAir can someone please tell me who I have to talk to #getittogether #findurgrip 
Almost home ...East Coast Freeze headed to PHL connect AVP TGIF http://t.co/WXowZhpgfL 
How do I redeem my pass to the admirals club? I have 1 free visit with my barclay card membership. And can I bring a companion? 
nothing important to do.  Why was I told to wait in the @AmericanAir line?  #patiencerunningout 
It's a debit card, but I am a Dividend member. 
if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I’ll ride US for life 
I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone. 
Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled. 
found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times. 
it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. "Please wait" then same form. 
and @american please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue 
thank you 
is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight? 
Good info, but am already signed up for all options.  None of which sound like they applied to the 'missing' emails. 
2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired. 
there is nothing tonight and I am on the flight now with GOGO internet is there a way that someone could send me a DM or email? 
thanks for nothing 
 is a bag that is   23”L x 9”W x 12”H  allowed as a carry on? 
yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-( 
will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered 
you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June. 
technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company. 
not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks 
stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy 
- delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week. 
it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers 
here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain 
Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again 
I did &amp; was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle. 
@AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing. 
rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows 
them and @AmericanAir 
your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out. 
still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory 
im on the plane not sure what you mean. We are sitting here. It's just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys 
I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal! 
worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together. 
connection made. Thanks again this week. #daddyshome 
 2 hours on hold and issue still not resolved. hope to make my flight in 12 hours. for every minute of talk = 20 minutes of hold 
yes I did thank you! They did a great job turning the flight in jan ! 
@AmericanAir thought u merged but #USAirways sucks #worstever http://t.co/myNZitCovn 
@AmericanAir are u paying incedentals? #noworstairline 
how can I make a purchase, you take the money but I don't have a reservation...Explain 
Now the next plane had a broken seat!  My row!  Another hour delay!  #mad 
/ @AmericanAir are incompetent. 
Just to follow up here is my experience: http://t.co/WJIiGZtiwg 
@AmericanAir u are the worst airline ever figure out the merger #dontmakemegooutside 
hello I have a question for you and your phone lines have jammed 
@AmericanAir I'm stuck in the airport in fresno trying to beat the storm to pittsburgh, and you guys have offered nothing. HORRID 
@AmericanAir I was supposed to get from fresno to pittsburgh by 10pm.  Instead I'm now not getting in until 4pm... tomorrow 
Need to change div miles ticket after travel started due to weather advisory. Told not possible unless flight Cancelled Flightled. AnyHelp? 
@AmericanAir did I mention I'm a silver preferred member and fly every week (not always with you), and not even a meal voucher? 
This is the last time I use your airline. I promise that! 
I will send an email with details Late Flightr. Thank you for responding. 
they weren't able to without reFlight Booking Problems and recharging the amount plus $25 fee for help over phone. Spoke to 2 agents &amp; Jeanine 
you have to be crazy! Treated my mom very poorly. Not happy! #usairwaysfail 
new slogan should be "if you don't want to arrive on time, pick us" 
Already tried. How about Conf # via DM 
US Airways website. So you double charge people when they book flights now? Apparently you have but I've never been booked twice 
13 years of Naval Service and I run the travel department for all my commands... 
@keithlaw  I flew US Air for the first time yesterday, got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story!  #Creditcardsales 
i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there? 
talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing. 
that's who I spoke to already. We've already booked another flight w/someone else. Thanks for your concern. Just wanted to 
express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family 
only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That's pretty awesome if you ask me... 
you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided 
I have corporate-paid travel in April. Is it possible to purchase an upgrade to first class now? 
flight #3797 treatment of passengers has been atrocious - over 2 hours delay only to now deplane and given no direction 
me too! 
transferred 4x pleeeeeeeease help! 
45 minutes on hold no help 
figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke 
I purchased a $49 upgrade on a flight 2 weeks ago and you gave it to someone else but I have not received a refund. Is this SOP? 
literally the worst flying experience of my life, and I have flown a lot 
experience exceptional service from Cherry at #DenverAirport.  #GreatService. #professionalism 
would be less annoying if road conditions weren't getting worse with every min U keep passengers captive for no good reason. 
Can you help me add a AAdvantage number and known traveler number to a reservation? 
trying to change flight because of airline travel advisory. on hold for 45 mins. Help! 
 you were always my go to. What happened?  Airbus over Boeing, and now no customer service? 
Website won't let me change online even though airline issued travel advisory, now on hold for 50 minutes. Help. 
Kudos to Robin at @PHXSkyHarbor Lost/Found for reuniting me w/ my iPad. She was delightful to work with! 
- the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks 
now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather? 
us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ? 
Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN 
worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you. 
How dirty does the damn plane have to be to take an hour to get the plane cleaned??? Refund me my miles😡. #wasteoftime #theworst 
I'm dumping this dividend miles card and forgetting your airline exists #ridiculous #theworstairlineever 
fuck you. 
Made about 30 calls to USAir today to merge of AAdvantage, Dividend Miles. Each time, says call back Late Flightr. #30timesenough 
-1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold &amp; disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won't go-HELP!!! 
I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible. 
@stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity 
Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online? 
refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed 
flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours. 
-doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip 
No worries I was able to read @stephenrodrick entire book while holding. #TheMagicalStranger 
I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami. 
the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to "go left" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there 
at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough 
but don't worry! They found a hotel, it's only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem. 
but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief. 
wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup 
ah, and I was only given one shuttle voucher, so if I do ever get back to the airport you'll be getting the bill 
but in the meantime I'll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st.  Thanks guys! 
I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure. 
REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea? 
It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime 
&gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service. 
so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards 
How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour? 
I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father 
you need to check information regarding hotels, shuttles, re routing flights, delayed flights 
so you're not honoring miles with @united that were traveled last year? 
Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA &amp; that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever 
hey guys just want to say I had the best flight ever! Thank you so much. I fell asleep and actually had a wet dream. 
...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight! 
I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call? 
Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic 
So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number? 
Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold &amp; $25. 
Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up. 
I did at 7 pm! Still no bag.. 
@AmericanAir flight 849's four subsequent delays destroyed my travel plans this evening. Looking to resolve this matter. 
I left something on a recent flight today. Who do I contact to retrieve it please? Thanks! 
landed at Phoenix, but we had to board a flight quickly to Vegas so no time at the airport. What now? 
Hey, my bag was damaged flying with you yesterday. What can I do? 
Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes... 
International 
Umm, can you define 'extra time'? 
Got it, thanks! 
dealing w fam emergency. Was told was rebooked this am to AA flight 4297 out of ORD and now it's not in system. Need help ASAP. 
no online clearly states I can NOT- It says to call res. I already explained that. 
u would think if u were going to Cancelled Flight my flight, you'd rebook our seats to something other than the last row. #usairwaysfail 
It's pretty hilarious that you want @SweetingR to finish his awful experience before doing something. Make it right, now. 
flight 705 FRA-CAT did some odd zig-zagging movements over Frankfurt...
Is everything ok? 
Also, get excited, because he's going to be unable to contact you all from his destination, so you get to talk to me. 
quick, let's board a plane so that we can sit on runway for 2 hours #clockwork #scareways #neverfails @AUmilo1 
Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race. 
you've completely ruined a pro athlete's ability to prepare for a race. Now you won't help him get the bike he needs to the DR?! 
is there a number to call to modify reservation.  Please help. Very frustrating with american and us air merger 
you call this a window seat? #airbus321seat14Fproblems http://t.co/ZKOE6clGiU 
bumping people off a flight ten minutes before takeoff because the flight is overbooked #fail 
incapable of seating a 2yo and mom together. Toddler in his own row #fail @CNN 
told to work it out ourselves #joke #fail 
ok. Thank you 
yes. But the manner with which it was done was harsh for those affected. Already checked in. No remorse. Weak alternatives. 
Trying to change my flight due to NYC travel advisory... your online system Cancelled Flighted my entire flight. Been on hold for over 1 hr 
any guesstimate on hold times? Can't change my flight online, at 45 mins and counting... 
So no idea? Thanks... 
Sitting on the runway at phl for the last 30 min because the correct weights for the flight aren't in the system? #jobfail 
your checkin at @PHLAirport is a #shitshow, and the agent behind the counter who tried to send me to the wrong destination=rude! 
followers please note that @USAirways is not taking customer service calls, nor responding by helping via soc. media #dontflyusairways 
I don't want a reservation change, just adding a service. Am going public with this to get help. 
trying 2 fly frm DCA to SRQ to visit a family member in hospice but 4532 was Cancelled Flightled, can someone assist me? 
we're glad to hear it. Out of curiosity, what causes such flight patterns? 
baggage drop at phl b/c is incredibly backed up... unacceptable service 
how do I find an email address regarding reativation of dividend miles. Nothing on website 
DCA to RSW at 8:30am Cancelled Flightled.  Rebook to Charlotte Cancelled Flightled.  Can we rebook selves online??? 
I fucking hate your customer service. I've been on hold all morning trying to figure out why you Cancelled Flighted my flight. 
I'm on vacation, This is the LAST thing I want to be doing. Is anyone even answering the phone? 
a big thanks to the gate agent flt5127..keeping us informed of the delay#greatcustomerservice 
or is anyone even responding to social media? AWFUL. 
Saying my friend missed her flight when she clearly sat next to me on the plane &amp; now you're Cancelled Flighting her flight home.. WTF!? 
can you please post wait time-have been on hold for two hours 
paid to upgrade to first class, went up to Admirals club at PHX airport to be turned away because our flight is to CUN and not MC 
so disappointed. Least you could do is give us access to admirals club for an hour before our flight to our wedding! 
check in at St. Louis is so rude, even the TSA is nicer than them. 
2 hours and 7 minutes. Just want to know I'm still in the queue... 
what's the point of email stating I didn't get bumped to 1st class? I know I'm not in first class, I booked the regular ticket 
on hold for 1hr, 30min. Not willing to hang in there as long as @franchise02. @AmericanAir answered in 7 min. U are not 1 yet. 
I've been on hold for approaching 2 hrs for an issue when I changed my ticket online. Frustrating. 
how long are you going make us sit in this plane while they repair it? Could I at least get a beer??? 
when trying to check-in online, it says to call...now I've been on hold for 2 hours...what to do? 
flight 813 DCA to CLT stuck waiting on CLT ATC. Cmon #FAA Missing flt 826 CLT to MBJ, hope you can rebook me! 816? 
Does anyone know the hold times for USAirways reservations? 
@franchise02 my friend has been on hold for 1.5 hours and still counting! 
now the 3rd issue with the plane is a fuel leak. They will let us know soon what they decide. #getmeoffthisplane #ineedabeer 
- been on hold with reservations for over 30 min already! #worstairline 
Was told it was a software bug. Told to call back this AM  Now your system is too busy to handle any calls this AM.  Clown shoes. 
Easily the most ridiculous experience trying to spend money with your company. 
your flight attendants are all jerks 🐳 
- I'm currently missing a basketball game due to your lost bag policy #terribleservice #wheresmyrefund 
Official time of call 3 hours 10 minutes but must add for 7 minutes your reservation agent was extremely professional and helpful 
I get extended hold times due to the weather...but 2-1/2 hours on hold (and counting). HELP!! 
- thanks for the 5+ hour flight from PIT to PHX with zero entertainment. Guess why I have a quarter million + miles on Delta 
on hold for 30 minutes &amp; counting to Cancelled Flight reservation booked within 24 hours - can I do it here? conf code: F6DK04 / XZMSCW 
 ! THE WORST in customer service. @USAirways ! Calling for over a month to book a flight! #poorcustomerservice #usairwaysfflyer 
"Owen F" at DCA Gate 42: #rude. 
- what is your policy regarding large-size passengers who cannot fit into a single coach class seat? 
@SeanVRose Sean - keep in mind if you call...plan on being on hold for 3+ hours 
trying to Cancelled Flight a flight urgently...get hung up on twice??? Sweet refund policy 
Sadly your words don't represent your company's actions. Talk is cheap. 
@PRof_Solutions Be prepared for 3+ hours hold times 
gold desk quoting me $900 to rebook due to weather. Can buy first seat on same flight for $440. Why? On hold for 45+ mins now 
why cant Sapphire members reach anyone on the phone? 
if one with @AmericanAir why can't you use American miles???? 
Stars aligned. Connecting flight was delayed into CLT. Made it! Thanks, glad to know someone is listening. Time for 80° in MoBay! 
I just learned that although there is travel policy and they waive the change fee-you will still be charged a $25 reservation fee 
Flight 1815 (N747UW) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @PHLAirport http://t.co/TtLwZgIyAg 
seems to be the only airline without a dedicated line for status members 
@USAirways based on the number of retweets and likes on my FB post, it's nice to know I'm not alone in my frustrations with you guys! 
how do you have only 1 flight into lexington this afternoon with the #1 @KentuckyMBB playing a big game tonight?  #DoBetter 
so I still need to stay on hold? http://t.co/04SDytT7zd 
what is with all the Cancelled Flightlations to PBI? We have pax at DCA that have been sent to 4 different lines between AAL and AWE. Help! 
@shivadelrahim what about upgrades? 
what is contact info to upgrade using advantage miles? 
flight 850. RUDE RUDE RUDE service! Awful. 
no one at #clt knows about runway issues..my inbound flight was only one delayed..connection left without me..now I'm stuck! 
Look at that. The flight I have been trying to book for 3 days is gone. I guess someone got through. Thanks! Keep up the #Failing 
 this is ridiculous at CLT  and we missed our connecting flight because of a chuckhole  on runway??  #shameful (1/1) 
I'm assisting @marccopely. He is already rebooked. Agents rude, unhelpful, discourteous. #FrequentFlyers appalled. Unacceptable!! 
what happens if the flight takes off before we Cancelled Flight?? That's the issue. We don't want to pay because of your inaccessibility! 
i've been on hold for an hour trying to change my flight!!! COME ON 
I'm trying to Cancelled Flight my flight within the 24hr window but have been on hold for over an hour. Is there an alternate # I can dial? 
chose you for a flight with very time sensitive arrival And you drop the ball. What gives? CLT #667 good way to lose my business 
Inexcusable behavior by gate agent. Sorry isn't enough. #Flight850 #CLT-#BNA 
enormous lines at customer service and two agents what kind of service is that .. http://t.co/ffanixJhwh 
I've been on hold for over 2 1/2 hours - there has to be an easier way to Cancelled Flight/get a refund... 😑😩 http://t.co/Cm4roIypc2 
providing poor customer service by responding to complaints with a copy and paste tempLate Flight unreLate Flightd to complaint #usairwaysfail 
undermines the intelligence of customers by ignoring their complaints with their copy and paste canned responses #usairwaysfail 
the American Eagle plane you're using for CLT to RDU is disgusting! You should be ashamed! #disgusting #ew http://t.co/B4xhiRuGzV 
after 5 flight Cancelled Flightlations we finally get a flight, get to the gate on time &amp; you've given our seats away? Seriously?? 
been on hold for 39 minutes and counting for a month old change fee refund request for a funeral.  This is pathetic. 
#SOS WHERE IS MY BAG ?

@AmericanAir WHERE IS MY BAG ?#SOS ITIS BEING LOST FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS ! #POORCUSTUMERSERVICE 
if my flight's been Cancelled Flightled, and I can't reach anyone over the phone or ticketing agents, safe to assume I wasn't rebooked?

thanks for getting us on ur plane. Awesome flight attendant who is making us smile after difficult travel. #customerservice 
your team member at DCA- Tamara R. is her name was awesome. You should have more employees like her!

 in don't have it on me at the time as I am taking Amtrak home. How do we call for partial refunds? 
I called twice the recording says that it has being delivered to my apt but it is not here ? 
Yes, it's February. Bad weather happens every winter. If you guys don't have the business sense to forecast that I'm at a loss. 
What's the seat assignment policy? Why let us choose a seat only to change it on us two weeks Late Flightr? 
Can't wait for the trip. Thanks for getting me there! 
you are cutting into my pregame time.  Go @KentuckyMBB !!!! 
#Unbelievable that for 2 consecutive days I can't get through to a person.  On hold over 2 hours and still going 
it's been three weeks since I was specifically told I would get a call back from your folks in AZ- should I keep being patient? 
thanks for the seat that doesn't recline. I'm shocked I'm not being asked to serve everyone drinks on the plane.  #DoBetter 
is the 7th circle of hell right after the dmv. #noshadetothedmv 
 And now your half assed plane is falling apart. Some one tell my family I love them! #DoBetter http://t.co/UA6doUA34l 
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled 4532 sch departure 8:38 am, wasn't snowing yet and other flights were still leaving #Fail

-beg to differ. 4 things booked wrong and still not fixed. Get your act together! #USAirSucks 
what am I paying you $275 for?   Fly the damn plane!  Not one announcement from the crew.  Let me know how you wanna refund me. 
i have been trying ALL WEEK to book a multi city award trip (can't book online) I'm told to call back some other time. What?!? 
  my miles will expire on 2/29 and it could take someone 10 days to respond...I have over 150000 miles that I do not lose i❤usair 
I love you guys!!! 
still Effin waiting... Not weather delays, not engine trouble, but lack of crew?  Are you shitting me? 
you guys straight up suck ass 
 big thank you to your ticketing agent Ute V at Dulles-Washington for OUTSTANDING guest service to get me rebooked 
looking forward to waiting on hold for 9 hrs to reschedule my flight.  Bunch of idiots work for this airline. 
haven't eaten all day either so lemme get that CC# so I can buy a burger across from the terminal.  #DoBetter @UsAirwaysSuck 
Your Baggage system has hung up on me twice because you have too many callers. I NEED TO FIND MY HUSBAND'S (@SweetingR) BAGS. 
can you tell me what the policy is for preboarding with small children? Is that still a thing? 
Been tweeting with the team at @AmericanAir who informed me that the problem is that you never sent his bags to them yesterday. 
This is ridiculous. You delayed my husband's flights &amp; made him miss his connection. Told him to leave his bags. Sent him (1/3) 
to a booked hotel for the night so I had to find him a room at midnight. Then say his bags will be on the plane, but can't (2/3) 
...be found when he checks in. Now no info. Please DM me and help me fix this NOW. (3/3) 
We did. @AmericanAir said to open one with you, too. 
already did. I travel for a living, no help at all that it will take 3-4 weeks for any repair. And I have to pay to ship to TX. 
another hour gone &amp; they sit with more snow on them! Seriously?! http://t.co/Fupf0UAyir 
Every time I try, the line is disconnected b/c the system says you have too many calls. Glad your screw up matters so much to you 
Ok Thanks 
this very pregnant lady's hoping &amp;praying hubbys flight from BWI gets off the ground! I'd like him to get here before baby does!

I was told a "return call" by a human 
Nick on flight 742 was awesome. Please reward him in some way!!! He has kept us smiling on a bad day of travel. #customerservice 
thank you! It's # 1875 from BWI, keep seeing different stats, from delayed to awaiting take off to delayed... 
Okee doke 
No Problem - he was the only person in the airport who would help :) 
thank you! You have always been so good to me. I will follow up. 
need seat assignments for one leg of family's return flight - can you please help via Twitter PM? 
can you DM me please? 
@AmericanAir Flight SF to NYC only made it to Philly. Ur customer service is telling me no refund for the last leg? #offensive 
how is it that my flt to EWR was Cancelled Flightled yet flts to NYC from USAirways are still flying? 
i hope i get the opportunity to join the team with this job opening! 
what about AA miles for USAir flights booked through American? 
Thank you!!! This whole crew has rocked through bad weather and diversion. Pilot keeping us well informed. #customerservice 
AND my rebooked flt isn't until Monday??  AND I don't get a voucher for a hotel?!  Never again, US airways. 
can you help us figure out our correct six digit confirmation number? 
you're right it's not fun. Especially when I don't have much of a choice. Lol. #curvygirltravels 
status shows "delayed" it was just "waiting for takeoff" so did it depart? It certainly didn't at 4:17pm. http://t.co/emRUbu4WzD 
woohoo! He still has 1 more flight but so happy to hear they're in the air, just about cried! (Must be the preggo hormones!) thx!

disappointed with your toll free number. Terrible customer service, my flight has been Cancelled Flightled would like to get home 
had to Cancelled Flight 4 of my flights because my versace biceps wouldn't stow completely under the seat in front of me. 
but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd. 
I did. They told me it was a 40 min wait &amp; they'd call back. It's already been 45 min. Horrible 
and apologies are thin when you don't even offer hotel vouchers to your stranded customers. 
why the hell u left *alliance and joined 1world is beyond me not a smart move time to start looking at other carriers 
will you fly me to somewhere warm? I'm tired of this snow! :( 
@AmericanAir  ..off to vegas http://t.co/AygAOeB6Uu 
call dropped &amp; no call back...another 45min-hour for another rep. The worst CS ever, online, by phone &amp; in person. 
@AmericanAir won't even refund for a flight they Cancelled Flightled #horriblecustomerservice

your ticket agents at gate 4 in Providence airport rocked tonight, especially Kristy, sorry if that is not the correct spelling. 
I made the change online, but couldn't check-in online, so had to call (3 hrs on hold btw). Shouldn't have been charged $25 
hell is terrible gate agents. And a three hour wait at the gate. 
the plane crew has been as professional and courteous as the gate agents were flustered. 
I'm flying with you this Summer. Will I be able to leave Miami Airport during my 12 hour stopover there? 
something is wrong with your phone system if you call someone and don't play the recorded flight notification. Is US643 Late Flight? 
So you Cancelled Flightled my flight AGAIN? are you paying for my hotel?! 
How long before departure do gates stay open? Will I make my connecting flight 1861 to RDU from flight 894??? 
I wasnt  flying your airline tonight, however a friend was and I was present for her help. I flying United and they could learn. 
worst experience of all time. Will never, ever, ever travel with you again. EVER

 and now I'm going to miss my G'ma's Memorial because I didn't #FlyDelta. 
Never mind that you could have told the gate I was on my way - you could delay 10 mins but not 15?

From here on out when I can at all I'm flying @Delta. Since when is a plane getting stuck in a drift for 2 hours a weather issue? 
please respond to me. I've been on hold on the reservations line for an hour and 45 minutes. I would really appreciate it. 
thanks for letting me know of the 12 hour delay and 2 hours on hold ?

can I get an update on flight 680 to DCA? 
hey folks where do you hide luggage when you Cancelled Flight a flight! You have 100 very angry people with no luggage 
That's clever. Its clear you need more agents. 94 min hold and counting. Flex workforces are highly possible in 2015 
can I at least get a response?  I tried the gate person (sent me the wrong way to cust srvc ) Cust Srvc (when I found them) 
cannot book to redeem companion fair without speaking to agent. $99 vs $1200, this is a family emergency #unacceptable

First class service on US 769 PHL-MCO today from the flight attendant in F. I didn't catch her name but she was top notch! 
worst trip ever!  Wish pilot would've let me off plane at 12pm during 1st delay.  Now 1030pm and still sitting on runway. 
delayed in philly since 130, sitting onTarmac since 8pm flight 1881 plz contact donaldaroberts1@gmail.com 
#not happy, wife 40th Bday trip. would like to be fully compensated for both flights 
understood. It simply feels as if the staff is not being entirely truthful about the situation. 
Thanks guys! Got hold of someone. Really awesome service I appreciate it :) 
over an hour is unacceptable wait time. thanks for nothing.  Be sure never to fly you again 
My brother &amp; his family stranded in CLT tonight bc gate E36 agent wouldn't hold plane for two minutes. Now driving in bad weather 
likelihood of PHL to BDL actually leaving tonight? 2 hour delay so far! 
And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage. 
I certainly understand the hold delays for WX reschedules - I've been on for 2hr15min - do you have an estimated wait time? 
Can't stress enough how awful the agent was for flight 5283. Knew 11 ppl from delayed flight were on way in mins, no compassion. 
depart from where? It departed PHX and was due to land at DCA around 8pm. 
he waited over two hours on the phone, had to book and get to MI, family member very ill, time of the essence 
- My guess is what happened in #Vegas ended up in #Philly #Sexy http://t.co/qgMfCB7yT4 
on hold 3 hours !!!!!! What's the number to speak to someone this is unacceptable I need to change flights 
please help on hold 3 hours can't change flights I'm stuck here 
weather doesn't excuse poor customer service, lack of info from staff or the fact staff haven't turned up 
how do I get thru on hold 3 hours 5 minutes . Is this normal ? My call is lost 
how do I change flights . 3 hours is crazy please help 
is flt 680 en route to DCA or BWI after diverting to RDU. Your phone service  sucks and your website is conflicting. 
@AmericanAir how do I get thru on hold over 3 hours ? 
not happy w/ app Late Flightly. Last time I flew wouldn't let me check in, This time I checked in went on Late Flightr says I never checked in 
help! Flight Cancelled Flighted, can't call because my phone doesn't work in Europe. Please help? Says I'm booked want to confirm. 
HELP! It says "the payment is denied" but my money has been taken out of my bank?  

And it says I have no trips coming up?? 
2 hours and counting waiting to get into a gate in Philadelphia. Just icing on the cake for a miserable flight experience 
flight 837 passengers stuck on plane in Philly. Where is the gangway?  We can't hear the pilot 
TRBL experience! 2 hrs on the Tarmac for an inch of snow IN PHL "No hanger open" &amp; "a pile of snow"?  #terriblecommunication 
@PHLAirport flight 837 landed at 10:30 pm and we are still on the plane. Help!!!!!! 
pullin some sh** delaying flights again... Smh @OBJ_3 http://t.co/Av2rfFHMcV 
by far the worst airline in history. I'll never ever fly your garbage again 
Yep, except this delay was due to a hasty and unwise decision to pushback other plane before the plows were done. #fail. 
no more hotel voucher? Everyone had to get one but not me...what do I do? Arrived from Amsterdam #SnowStorm 
stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS 
it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault 
it was your fault the flight was delayed to begin with. I shouldn't have to check my bag if there's a bunch of space 
been sitting on the tarmac for 90 mins now bc engine is broken. How are u going to compensate passengers #WorstAirline 
I had to sit in your kitchen and move stuff around so I had what I needed. I'm extremely disappointed in your service 
on top or having to check my bag I had to wait over 30 min for my bag to come out at baggage claim. Thanks for wasting my time 
what's going on with passengers diverted to CLT on FLL to PHL flight that left at 830 tonight? 
Flight 496. How are u going to compensate me for sitting on the tarmac for 90+ mins and missing my PHX - BOS connection? 
I have fam thats supposed to fly 2/22 that are currently in the hosp.3 trys to speak to a human, yr phone sys cuts off. pls hlp! 
3hr30min right now...  any end in sight? 
I have been I hold for 40 min. My 5:50 flight just got Cancelled Flightled and rescheduled for Monday. This is unacceptable! 
Can I book award travel on Etihad with Dividend Miles? 
yes - tells me the only way to mod plans is to call the 4322 number. 
Delays due to faulty engine light. Great work guys. Coming up on 2 hrs sitting on the plane #WorstAirlineInAmerica 
Cancelled Flightled flight 1796 baggage held hostage at CHL. No communication. 
This is garbage, been trying to book a reward flight and then it got Cancelled Flighted and still can't get anyone on phone. Unacceptable 
My wife, sick 3yr-old-twins, and I have been waiting in line now for 2hrs to see an agent! Phone agent said nothing til Tuesday! 
As a member of the news media, the awful service of the last few days won't go unnoticed. 
stranded at BWI after two diversions. No cust service, no transport. Dumped here. Terrible customer service! 
You landed me at #BWI instead of @Reagan_Airport  and have no plans for me to make it home to DC. How do you suggest I get home? 
its fine. 

Just wondering where my money went... 
I have been on hold for over one hour waiting to reschedule a flight. How much longer should I expect? 
actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one. 
You won't give us a hotel or food. Can you at least suggestion options for making it to the metro city I have a ticket to? 
4 hours . How do I change my flight that was Cancelled Flightled ? 
#Wronganswer. Talk is cheap. Customer service is the action of making things right for the customer. #fail again. 
in a few weeks 
question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city 
are you going to do anything to help stranded travelers of flight 680?! No communication from anyone. All of us dumped here. 
just hit 4hrs.  what is typical wait time right now? should i drive 2h30m to the airport service desk? 
Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this? 
you airline is doing rather poor right now. In SLC waiting to take off. Was suppose to take off now 2 hours and 3 minutes ago! 
They provided no options. Since you all have a better sense of the weather, I hoped you could suggest. 
ok thank you! Very helpful! This is why you're my favorite airline! 
@traveloneworld .. Utterly frustrated after 4 hours on hold call was disconnected. I need to amend a Flight Booking Problems. HELP! OW Emerald 
even alternate options are allready full...even with hotel voucher...no more room in philly? 
Your customer service is  non-existent/ terrible. Dozens waiting for bags not placed on our flight, no staff anywhere #neveragain 
I intend to..very much. My 4,000 followers will as well. 
can a real person help me here? This customer service is poor. I'm at the mercy of someone since the flights are disappearing. 
I never made a reward reservation becuase no one ever answered the phone. The online one I made got Cancelled Flighted and I can't change 
keeps dropping my call and won't even let me stay on hold because they are "too busy" #idontwanttocallback 
I was on hold for 2 hours and still no answer. Is this really how you run your business? http://t.co/P8xFhq4kps 
surely there are some other ways to help me - I can't really afford another 4 hours now. Pls follow me so we can DM 
But every time I call I'm on hold for 45 min and then get disconnected. Any way someone can help? 
@jtrexsocial 5 hours on hold ... Safe to say no one is working . 
delayed depart bc ur flight attendant wasn't there. Then after landing took 3 hrs to get a gate. Now it's another he and NO bags 
@_RobPrice  how can he try again it will be 5-6 hours before he gets help.  Contingency plans non existent. 
still waiting on your reps to show. Now 40 mins into waiting in below freezing weather waiting for a cab. 
@nm4agoodlife      5 hours on hold and no answer . Guess the synergy of a merger was really planned out 
I better get a free flight 
can you please have your employee that has been called 5 times by the flight crew finish maintenance on US 734 so we can depart! 
@ch_mom Please reach out to our crewmember for assistance. Our apologies for the long wait.” #generic 
HELLO?! It's been FOUR HOURS since plane landed!   Flt 630 phx to JFK.  3 hrs on Tarmac waiting 4 gate. Plus an hour no bags yet 
thank you for leaving my 74 y/o grandma stranded because connecting flt could not wait 10 minutes. I will never fly you again 
Charlotte Staff needs prayer....disappointed in response to mishaps ......lotttttttt of pissed off people here!!!! 
can you please train your mechanics? Teach them to bring the tools to fix the plane with them and not leave them in the hanger. 
yes, i am as well.  **FIVE** HOURS ON HOLD, FOLKS. Can you PLEASE tell me if this is typical?! Trying to be understanding here. 
@nburnside26 Well if you really didn't like them then she would be on an airplane. #FIOUSAirways 💁 
I've been on hold since 11:30pm how many customer service reps do you have?

Are you guys awake? Need help with delayed flight to get protected on Late Flightr flight from PHL. 
how do you do that? You guys need to have much better communication. How? How can we do that? 
three hours on hold then disconnected. Conf EBHSET. Need to be home Sunday for interview 
is the worst. Why on earth would @AmericanAir merge with them? I won't be flying either of them any time soon. 
Hooray! I've now been on hold for over an hour. I've never loved Southwest more. 
@AmericanAir Just had to buy a "safety" ticket online. You'll refund whichever ticket(s) are unused, in full, without penalty. 
No US Air ppl anywhere in PHL directed stranded pax. Kudos to the PHL employees getting off work at midnight. Only help we got. 
tell my professors that when I don't show up to class/write my midterm because I'm stuck with no flights home 😠 
abandoned 40 Boston bound fliers...someone in management needs to #saveface and #showup 
who do we voice our concerns to when we can't get home with our 8 month old after waiting to taxi to a gate for 3 hours?

@AmericanAir I was meant to fly on Sat, you just made it Tues, I can't afford to stay in a hotel for another TWO nights! 
@AmericanAir Suggestions , been on hold 2 hrs for flight that is now about to pass departure...Dealing w ny weather, need change 
how do you manage to place a family of 5 into a plain with none of them sitting next to each other one of them being a 3yr old 
worst experience ever!!!! 
worst experience with you. Cancelled Flightled flight, no voucher and no luggage because "ramp was broken." No other ramps in Charlotte?? 
have you ever lost luggage with an infant and a 4 year old? Then customer service never answered the phone. I've tried all night. 
your airline also delayed our bags to us for 4 hours &amp; refused to ship them to our local airport #disappointed #stillbagless 
forgot to call in the copilot so we're stuck on the plane in PHL. Looking fwd to being stranded in CLT. Day 2 of flight fails. 
We've been on hold for over 7 hours after my wife's flight was Cancelled Flighted. 
4 hours on hold to change a Cancelled Flightled flight. Completely unacceptable!!! 
Sounds like  @USAirways should have planned better since this weather was no surprise. Completely unacceptable wait times!!! 
XNA has TSA Precheck! Would be nice if your system knew that. 
ever think about hiring more agents? Come on now. Don't you think 4 hour holds is a little ridiculous? Get a clue 
- what a disaster! Flight 3739, missed passenger count by 5 since it was done manually!!  Really??? 
OK, I guess the weather has been rough but I have been trying to sort out missing air-miles for days. Any suggestions? 
truly been the worst experience this weekend. Delayed, rerouted 3x, now not boarding A 715 flight and says flight is "on time" 
once again your company actualy put people in weird situations.Your hostel voucher was fake.Snow is ok but no lies please 
8 hrs of wait time is unbelieavle unaccpetable biggest airline in the world should have failback call centers 
my phone has been on hold since midght  fkn 7 hrs of hold ?? Unacceptable!!!!!!!!

I just got hanged up on trying to get to an agent. Can you help? 
You are 0 for 3 so far in on-time flights on this vacation.

@AmericanAir  is there anyone answering phones today??? Listening to same damn messages for 1:10 minutes

@AmericanAir  stranded in North Carolina and trying to figure out options but can't get anyone to talk to

- almost 2 hrs 30 mins on hold - any idea how much longer? 
on hold with 800-428-4322. Flight from DSM to DCA was Cancelled Flighted (4473). Know when it will fly?

My bags were supposed to be delivered to NYC last night (missing since Thurs) but are not here. Can someone call me? 
I really appreciate there not being an easy way to get another flight when mine has been delayed over 2hrs for mechanical reasons 
instead of tweeting your customers apologizing why don't you pick up your phone 
Many thanks for your reply! http://t.co/6CGFv02gzb

I did they are busy 
@nanceebing 4 hour hold times at the moment...and counting. #disgrace 
been on hold 2 hours for a Cancelled Flighted flight. I understand the delay. I don't understand you auto-reFlight Booking Problems me on TUESDAY. HELP! 
And the lies continue. Just waited another hr to get boarding passes for flight supposedly created today which is now Cancelled Flightled?! 
Hmmm. Did the flight even really exist or did they just create it last night to get people off their backs? #usairsucks 
I can't wait for the @nytimes and @WSJ to find out how poorly @USAirways handled this situation. #shameful http://t.co/HHOxQPsUbA 
worked w/ Tiffany H at cust service desk in Charlotte and she was helpful and patient. Still stuck, but she was great. 
no one is coming to line. On hold for 4 hours. Can u help here if I provide conf code? 
agent won't hold for connection arriving Late Flight. 7 min before departure time but 3 min too Late Flight. Flt 1903 gate c19. Disappointed 
why did you Cancelled Flight flight 1773 to phl, while delta flew a flight at the same time, on time? you Cancelled Flighted for no reason 
100 feet from the gate at PHL, but no ground crew. You can't make this up. 
Handled. I found tkt on floor dropped by someone. No way - I’m in wheelchair - to get to podium. 
your customer service is a joke. First a mechanical Cancelled Flightation, now weather. On hold since 5:30 am. No humans. Pls call me! 
you keep suggesting people call 800-428-4322 but we just end up on hold for hours. You seriously don't have a better method?! 
u guys suck 
Now going on 26 minutes on hold. 
@AmericanAir Almost half hour on hold.  My cell phone battery is dying.  Thanks for your loyalty from a "Platinum" member 
my in-laws flight Cancelled Flighted 4 tonight. U auto rebooked 4 flight on Tuesday that doesn't work. Can you help reFlight Booking Problems them? 
My family, friends and colleagues will NEVER  fly USAir again. Bad weather happens. The good airlines seem to communicate better. 
what is the expected wait time to speak to someone via 800 number? 
my friends are stuck at KPHL and not getting any help from anyone, can you guys contact them please? 
@AmericanAir any help regarding flights out of KPHL would be much appreciated 
my option is to use twitter. Most of the people working for u have no clue what they do. they tell you to go to A4 but its b16 
your customer service is atrocious. 
at least they make you run so you want yo buy this fresh diet coke...nice bizness plan. Its all about marketing right? 
@Expedia 7 Hours for my friend to rebook his trip to Korea after @USAirways Cancelled Flightled a connecting flight to Chicago = IDIOTIC. 
On re-accommodation number Lisa (Liza?) in Raleigh was very helpful 
i ve been told that you get a percentage on every plastic bottle that is sold around yout departure section...turn up the heat 
The automated message isn't helpful and it's impossible to speak with a human right now. Desperately need our luggage :( 
Collectively since Friday I've been on hold with customer service for over 3 hrs. My issue is not resolved... so frustrated! 
you can't control the weather but you can control customer service. Without luggage for 24 hours &amp; still yet to speak to a human. 
@Sb5551 Um, WE knew this storm was coming, ? Is why didn't USeless Air?  Staff accordingly u idiots! 
I have a MAJOR complaint that I want to address w/you about my hand luggage courtesy check-in. What's the best way to do this? 
i want an Icecream baby... 
how is it possible that you don't have a call back service? An automated message telling us to call back Late Flightr is so unhelpful. 
@AmericanAir my friends are stranded at KPHL and the representatives there won't even give them food vouchers…any help please? 
please thank Mellie at CAE, Tammy in baggage claim at CLT 4 #excellent customer service 2day, BUT I have a complaint. 
@nburnside26  U hate delays, too?  But u have her $$ &amp; are holding her hostage!  #GoingForGreatnessFAIL 
Mellani B. and whole team in Columbia SC are absolute superstars. Incredibly helpful. 
have had a medical issue Late Flight yesterday and need to change my flight today been on hold for an hour and still not through 
horrible customer service, flying from Miami to Philadelphia, sent to Charlotte, now can't get out of Charlotte! 
@msscottwg  "That's unusual" means we screwed up but will never admit to it!  #GoingForGreatnessFAIL 
40 minutes in baggage claim and no sign of luggage from our flight. UsAirways- your incompetence is overwhelming 
how aggravating, zone 5 boarded, overhead empty but forcing bag check. Better not loose bag again! flt1727 http://t.co/w3XS6TVpZg 
flight 623 den to phx: flight attdt decides to stay downtown and be an hour Late Flight so entire flight delayed, she better get fired! 
any chance u can help our family rebook their flight that was Cancelled Flightled, #4487? 
Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight tomorrow and not reFlight Booking Problems me on another one. #usairwaysfail 
F623 DEN:PHX. Serious display of poor customer service exhibited by flight crew today.   #newamericanairline #cheapslogannotmotto 
between 3 of us, it is costing over $1000 to get home TODAY for no reason... Where do I send my receipts to be reimbursed? 
I have been calling for 3 days! 
2 hours?! And just got disconnected. 
this is the worst customer service I have ever had. Rebooked to tues but seat available on mon. Wtf. Contact me. 
@ALfamilyoffour maybe if there was anyone answering the phone they would. "Please call back Late Flightr".For 18 hours? Not good enough 
with a glass of wine once we hit altitude? 
I got rebooked at 3am after they woke me up just tried to call twice and got hung up on. Worst customer service. 
a member of your staff at PHL just gave us excellent customer care. Shame the same couldn't be said for the past 24 hours. 
was on the phone for over an hour waiting without an answer. 😩 
F623 DEN:PHX impressive lack of concern by 1hr+ Late Flight flight attndt wrecking havoc on customer travel #smugsmirk #norush 
I waited customer service 32 minutes on the phone w/o response. Had to hung up in the end since my battery died due to waiting! 
now you don't know where my luggage is?  Seriously? 
first flight Cancelled Flightled, connecting flight delayed so will completely miss next connection no response on hold 2 hrs HELP me 
Past tense re help. No more. It’s been even more miserable than usual at CLT. 
your service sucks. 
sadly they've tried that and airport agents…no flights so they're stranded at PHL. No chance of a hotel for them? 
I packed a carry on for a reason. Thanks for making me check it. I hoped for better customer service in CLE also. #nothappy 
color me confused but why would i need to call and do this. Update your procedures and policies. You can see who is connecting 
worse experience. Clt to DC. Oversold by 20, lost CARRY ON luggage.Cancelled Flightled connecting flight to NYC. #flydelta 
with chocoLate Flight please... i m melting http://t.co/jJdoSFYIBM 
I finally spoke to a person. Despite the mind boggling wait time, the rep was very pleasant and very helpful. Kudos to her. 
3rd connecting flight delayed but still cannot make it &amp; still unable to speak to a real person 
if you mean by posted, no USAir empl to direct anyone, 800# not accepting calls, no contact from USAir re: rebook #greatjob 
using all of my monthly minute on hold with you assholes 
now in a black hole of your phone system 
You suck!!  Do you even know the meaning of contingency plan????? 
No one answers your reservation phone line. I need to book travel with a  companion certificate. How do I get through?!!! 
am 2. 1/2 hours from airport sure would like to talk to someone 
Been on hold 2.5 hours now! System hung up on me twice after an hour holding. :(  Trying 2 correct online Flight Booking Problems error. #unhappy 
Cancelled Flightled my flight then put me on a flight the next day.I need help from somebody other than a robot. PLEASE!!! Much appreciated 
was on hold for four hours, never got connected. Came to the airport and your rep essentially told me and everyone else to screw 
this travel day sucks but Malcome K at gate 39 rocks.  This guy is the brand you want to be. Replicate his approach and style. 
any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure 
why now just announce delay of 4478 from PVD when you knew captain was already on delayed flight coming in? Frustrating 
4097 DCA to BNA. Just told they need to do 1.5 hrs worth of maintenance. Was supposed to leave at 8:50 am. [sigh] 
 where's my bag?  In line 200 deep at DCA. Agents say call 800 #.  800# says talk to agents. Abysmal customer service 
3rd time cut off after 10+ minutes on hold with Chairmans desk?!??? Wth how are we supposed to rebook Cancelled Flightled flights?!?!? 
on hold for TWO HOURS now, pick up the PHONEEEEE 
flight 1735 sitting fully loaded for over an hour. Air conditioning barely working :-( 
Thanks to the friendly US Airways staff that helped me get booked on various flights to get home today.  Almost there! 
2+ hr wait &amp; really bad exp @PHLAirport. luggage won't arrive w/ me Do I really have 2go back LAS airport 2 pick up when arrives? 
I know you're dealing with the weather, but @PHLAirport is a hot mess. Pls send reinforcements 
I tried calling for yet another delayed flight and was told the phone line couldn't handle the volume and was hung up on. Twice. 
Your customer service line keeps telling me call back Late Flightr and disconnects. How can I talk to someone about my flight? 
E190 lands without nose gear in Houston - @Flightglobal http://t.co/Yf9NhMwyFF 
My hubby has a 5hr layover in DFW fm the cxl'd flt. Pls help get him home sooner if you can! Any room on S/by 2 BWI or PHL today? 
if I try and call your reservations line will someone answer the phone now or will I be on hold for an hour again? 
needs to hire more people http://t.co/3LPVFhKy2F 
just informed of three hour delay. Pick up the phone and get me on another flight! 
@British_Airways three hour flight delay. On the phone for 45min and counting. 
can you get me home to Syracuse? After 6 Cancelled Flightled flights, one re routing three of us are sitting in Charlotte 
Uh yeah. Flight boarded &amp; now 1 hr Late Flightr we still sit. Update on 4435 to DCA? 
over 2 hours and 14 minutes on hold and counting. Thanks for the help! #customerservice #brutal http://t.co/VsKXyAmnom 
there is no extreme weather in Miami. Pick up the phone. Hire more people. 
Three hour delay from Miami to London.  None of the other flights today are delayed. Put me on another flight! 
WORST customer service ever!!! 
NOW they're not even accepting calls AT ALL! Come on. 
on hold 2 hours 54 minutes. What's going on? 
45 minutes and moved two feet in BZE. 👎 http://t.co/AwGjkjIIac 
not impressed with your customer service. everyone has been unhelpful and incredibly rude. 
are the bags off Flight 1898 CLT to JFK? We landed last night just before midnight. 
, I am embarrassed for us air and their inability to manage during weather delays.handling of # 4435 is an example 
might possibly be THE WORST airline ever! I think it's time to brush up on customer service! #sorude 
overloads small plane with extra baggage and then. Has to take them off... Poor execution #4435, 75 minute delay... 
@JosephTReis Dont bother. They dont pick up the phone. Worst customer service going 
all these planes sitting here and no one going home. #usairwaysfail http://t.co/jN3V3k3qGv 
luggage and contents destroyed both on outbound trip last week&amp;inbound lastnight in philadelphia #Careless 
No thank you. @AmericanAir was responsive &amp; I found alternate travel home. 
is the @comcast of airlines #2hrs35minOnHold 
pretty upset I drove from Philly to MHtT still no info on my bags. What's the deal! 
@JosephTReis Can't believe advice to call customer service. I was on hold for 3 hrs this morning and finally gave up. 
I have been trying to get through to a representative for 7 hours aboout my Cancelled Flightled flight. Have you simply given up? 
Round Two of being THE worst airline ever. 
@TheHaileyTate Another blatant lie from @USAirways 
on delayed flight from Phil to stt and looks like we'll miss the car ferry to at john where our lodging is. Help with housing? 
@corybronze  INCONVENIENCE? Are you people freaking nuts? This guy has TWO KIDS WITH HIM and you STRAND him in an airport! #FAIL 
Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled. said I'd have to pay $75 for earlier flight at next gate. Today @delta proactively offered same for $0 
quit being cheap and hire some call center employees. It shouldn't take half a day to call you 
@USAirways I used my AAdvantage Number connected to the USAirways when I booked tickets for friends. Will it benefit my account? 
That link doesn't work on mobile. 
@ClaudOakeshott how about a link that works pls Nothing but complete frustration w usair last 12 hrs 
4 hrs and counting today alone... like I don't have other things to accomplish today than to just keep holding!!! 
come scoop 
final count 3 hours 24 minutes on hold to be told I need to log in to U.S. Airways website and there was nothing else to be done 
what's your pet policy? 
Yes, there is horrible snow. But seriously, can you not hire more people to answer the phones? Competitor have call back numbers. 
@MrRenevendez I've been trying to contact them for 24 hours already! Yesterday I waited 7 hours today 5+! http://t.co/gn30p75KqB 
next time you promise an ontime departure you should stick to it instead of stuffing us in this sweat box with no air 
stuck on Tarmac for 30 mins at PHL waiting for someone to load baggage,ridiculous http://t.co/BRCsjBxG2s 
you should get better employees✌️ 
your mobile app is horrible!  Needs a major overhaul 
should look into better service✌️ 
flights to Dfw Cancelled Flightled today? 
your customer service in Philly is deplorable, rude &amp; unprofessional gate agents after delays &amp; Cancelled Flightations #takingthistothetop 
Look into better service. 
After today,no reason 4 anyone to not approve merger with @AmericanAir,other airlines have no reason to fear losing business to U 
are there such things as non-delayed flights or na? Get your shit together and get me out of here 
Its not just PHL, at BTV today made to deplane because "it's Sunday and we don't know if maintenance will be available" 
your service in Philly is unacceptable. Look into better service✌️ a 16 yr old shouldnt have a hard time http://t.co/WDAKTmr7Mj 
I've been on hold at the reservations desk for 3 hours. HELP!!!! 
churn rate increasing by the second 
would love it if you could get my wife home sometime soon - she has been stuck in Orlando and now stuck in philly for too long 
30 min delay for mechanics to replace rivets. 30 mins Late Flightr, turns out mechanics had wrong size rivets. 35 more mins. Pathetic 
in 140 characters? Yea right.   Thanks for patronizing. 
Painless and effortless flight from Indy to PHL... Our flight attendant, Tory, was fantastic. Give that lady a raise ASAP! 
now you just hang up on me. I’m starting to think this is personal! 
and no offers to provide us with a hotel or anything for a flight that is over 19 hours away! 
i did and i'm not stupid. i've done web development for 19 yrs. the issue (now confirmed by your support) is YOUR website. 
UR employee named VAN @ ticket counter in #Philadelphia. EXTREMELY RUDE! a Father trying to get home to sick kid missed flight. 
missing our connection due to delay out of @LAS. Told not looking good for tmrw either. We will be stuck in #CLT. Help!

Cancelled Flightled flight this AM. There was avail flight to PHL today u said was sold out. I had to buy 2nd ticket, u need to refund me. 
according to @wtop DCA seems to be recovering nicely from yesterday's snow so why are you Cancelled Flightling flights out there? 
now after an hour on the plane and knowing of a maint issue ahead of time they just announced another 30 mins. Y r we on plane? 
 you Cancelled Flighted &amp; rescheduled my flight &amp; still getting updates &amp; can't find my current flight on my account http://t.co/8Je1h3666w 
1 hour and counting on hold :( why? http://t.co/clOB5qwMXR 
What's the contact number for the corporate baggage office in Phoenix? 
has failed me all day long, should I blame it on @AmericanAir ? 
i will be on this plane while on the ground longer than i will be in the air. US5235 
just told by supervisor that they won't guarantee the empty seats to standby passengers with flights Cancelled Flightled so can sell them 
I sympathize re:weather issues, but when times get tough, call in more folks. Over two hours on hold for 4-minute fix. #FAIL 
really nigga.. Ur a fuck boy 
@AmericanAir as a Gold Dividends member, why can't I get anyone on phone to handle my Cancelled Flighted American flight tonight 😡 
Is your reservation phone number working? Called 10x in the last 3 days, and haven’t gotten through. 
Just Cancelled Flight every flight I have why don't you. 
@united each says the other has my luggage. On hold almost 3.5 hrs with @USAirways. @united hung up 3x. http://t.co/dr5oCtp1DY 
on the phone over an hour waiting for customer service  got wrong fight information cost us 6 hours from trip. Frustrating!!!

2nd plane forced to get off due to mech and wait for 3rd need housing and meals in STT need help b4 we arrive at STT please 
this is how concerned your gate attendants at C26 are this afternoon. #nocommunication #nocrew http://t.co/hFjYN2vtVj 
suggest you failures make a HUGE donation to @the_USO  Charlotte, NC as THEY provided GREAT customer service today, unlike you. 
-- I've been on hold 40 mins to Cancelled Flight my reservation for this afternoon. Is there another way? Web tells me to call. 
customer service fail... Todays experience will ensure I do my best NEVER to utilize you again...

I promise, if I can help it I will nvr fly w/u again. Even if I have 2 pay more $$$ 2 fly w/ sum1 else #badcustomerservice 
I have been on hold for over 3 hours.  Please help! http://t.co/tyXAZtMQ1U 
Really hoping I don't get charged for this flight because they couldn't handle the influx of calls. Bummer. 
Its pretty ridiculous that at PHX sky harbor you have 4 (!) employees working check in on a SUNDAY afternoon. 30 min &amp; counting.. 
you have got to be kidding me!  No info on 4565 from DCA to BGR and your phone line tells me to call back Late Flightr? 
thanks for being so bad you make a two day train trip look appealing!! 
AA Gate Supervisor emplid 600117 allowed flight AA67 to leave JFK to SJ on 20feb15 w/o 8 customers that made final boarding call. 
@BarclaycardUS 1 hr wait so far for customer service. yes bad weather but do air traffic controllers answer your phones?!?? 
when AA gate supervisor 600117 was asked for his superiors name, response received was "the CEO of #AmericanAirlines" #merger 
thanks to you, you have now incurred us approximately 2000 dollars in fees due to a staff members screw up.  #neveragain 
where are my bags? 
Ill never fly you again due to the emotional &amp; financial stress you have caused me because of one of your staff members errors. 
3818 delayed. blue skies all over. #whyisusairALWAYSDELAYED??? 
Please can someone contact me regarding my missing bag? It has been 3 days. Online tracking shows nothing. 
 Flight 4454 aircraft at gate, but no crew?  Will be 2+ hours Late Flight to destination. Come on! 
flight 2022 out of Phil, no update and was supposed to leave 15 minutes ago.  Sitting in airport, wondering#irritated 
your customer service at CLT is terrible!!! My flight was delayed from JFK for 2 hours!  Get to CLT to horrid customer service! 
more like USDELAY-ways. Another long 'paperwork' reLate Flightd delay - Friday in Charlotte. Today in Philly. #letsgoalready 
 Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC- 
it's unacceptable the way your agents at the gate treat paying customers!!! 
wasted a day of my vacation after problems with not one but two planes... #waitinginphilly #flight838 
Ann Marie at LGA is the best ticket agent ever! #excellentcustomerservice 
my friends at KPHL were told by your rep "if it were me I woulda just gone home this am and tried again tomorrow." 1/2 
"We can't help you. We don't put people up in hotels when you miss a flight it's against policy." 
thank you for correctly interpreting my last tweet as non sarcastic and delaying my flight again. YYZ Terminal 3 dance party? 
is it policy to tell customers "We can't help you?" I'm sorry but this is unacceptable 
how hard is it to unload bags in order of arrival? 45 mins and counting for flight 699 
6 hours, no agent. Should I keep waiting? 
#695 might have been Cancelled Flighted? mechanical issue. 6 hours Late Flightr 100 people still waiting and Zero information. Please send help. 
@AmericanAir we are missing our connection due to delay out of LAS. What are we supposed to do now? 
the ads on your phone systems when waiting for a rep is the most annoying thing ever especially when waiting for over 10 mins... 
how do you lose a pilot???? 
and after six hours even the gate agent got fed up and left us all on line in front of an empty desk. Stay classy US Air. 
Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week. 
I tried reaching out to you guys I'm running out time and patience I just want my flight to be honor and I want a confirmation! 
thanks for the worst customer service on the face of the earth. I loved the 5+ hrs on hold along w 2 Cancelled Flightled flights 
spoke with your reps in NH and PA. Very poor communications. Bags still sitting in Philly. TRAIN YOUR STAFF 
we've now learned to never fly with u again. You've lost 16 customers from our group + the hundreds more from our company 
US Airlines 699 LA to RDU is holding onto baggages for an hour already and everyone is still waiting!? 
despite mechanical issues and many delays followed by a Cancelled Flightlation, still getting to Vegas thanks to great gate agents! 
if you are going to make me wait in the phone for a long time can you at least turn off the ads they are eating away at my soul 
has the WORST customer service and their flights are always delayed 
when do we get our baggages? @usaireays 699 LA to RDU http://t.co/vU5lBZXtRX 
on hold for 2+ hours.. Can I book using a Take Flight voucher online?? 
if my flight, 4035, is delayed, what time do I have to arrive at BHM? 
#usairways Raleigh NC; baggage carousel staff were aggressive towards people waiting 1 1/2 hrs for bags. Flight 699 
CSTSVC in PHL honors UR system over my reality. No RCD of change in HPN. Now extra hours in PHL or $75 to get to CLE. 
No I need the corporate office number please as that is who is dealing with this for me. It's a 480 number. 
Everyone on Flight 669 from LAX to RDU enjoyed waiting an hour &amp; a half in baggage claim for their bags just now 
On hold for &gt;70 mins on my 3rd attempt just to get a receipt showing change fees for an upcoming flight. Please help! 
Y'all need to get it together 
Cancelled Flights my flight to NY 3 times, then once I make it here they decided for S&amp;Gs they'll Cancelled Flight my return flight too. Thanks. 
I saw online you had fee but I was wondering if there was a way to pay for it ahead of time, instead of at the kiosk 
24 hrs Late Flightr still not home. Hotel, rental car etc with a 5 yr old, what happened to "customer service is our first priority" 
made it to the Bahamas for work but my luggage didn't. I know #travel happens but is there anyway I can get more help/info? 
so apparently all of your computers crashed at BWI?  Any update on when flights will be moving? 
thanks for making me check my bag when the space was empty and to the flight attendant for the dirty look http://t.co/9rx5HOmM25 
What a great way to kick someone when they are down. Cancelled Flight a noon flight and rebook me on one two hours south from here tomorrow 
I left an item on plane BOS-PHL on Friday.  I've called PHL US Airways # &amp; left 6 msgs. No return call what to do at this point. 
But good luck getting there! Not cool. 
@AmericanAir LAX connect from term 6 to term 4.  55min layover due to delay. US755-AA2595. Is this realistic? Can 2595 be held? 
glad people can put their coats in the storage area though. It would be super unfortunate to leave those on the floor 
I do but the real ? Is why your staff can behave offensively. Flight 699. Please look into it. Message me if you want particulars 
please help! No bags, no way to get through to customer service since 8AM this morning! Help!! 
@AmericanAir @GMA could not have had a worse airline experience. Rude, unhelpful, got yelled at😳. @JetBlue need your help 
thank you so much for asking us to pay $700 to switch to a different flight so I could spend more time with my dying nephew. 
is really good at deferring responsibility. 
horrible cust service exp at DIA today. Wife waited 3 hrs on the plane b/f flight 695 was Cancelled Flightled. Still waiting for bags. 
Best part was hearing the attendant give a voucher to person next to me for hotel at BGR. Then my guy saying "we don't do that" 
he is 8 months old and is suffering from a rare form of cancer. Your customer service agents had no compassion and I am disgusted 
that you would let us just switch to a different set of flights so we could spend time with the family after he passes away... 
his name is Rett Cavan, he has a gofundme page, and is going to take his last breath tonight. This airline only cares about money 
Seriously? I should keep trying after seven hours. That is your corporate policy? #usairwaysfail 
- flight was Cancelled Flightled to Buf today. Waited in line for 2+ hrs &amp; cus service was rude. No flight until Tues. Need to get to ROC. 
Can you guys please give an update?  Been sitting on Tarmac on flight 601 yet the website still says it's on time? 
provided the best service for me today! Thank you so much :) 
will you hold #475 today for connecting passengers coming from delayed flights? 
on plane from BOS to CLT for 60 mins. Still at gate. Crew says system-wide computers preventing paperwork. Any info you can give? 
@AmericanAir Just got off Int. Flight #799. Your Intentionally rude staff made for a horrible 8hr+ flight on an unsuitable plane. 
i have been tryng to rsrv a flight over the phone over the past 4 days and keep getting an automated message to call back?!?!?! 
epic fail @ CLT ystrdy w/Cancelled Flightled flights. No staff, no communication &amp; no refund for unused portion of tix. Keep it classy guys 
Huge system problems at DCA.Manual check in; flight boarded but sitting at gate due to system issues. Frustrated Chairman member 
No flights out of Philly because of system wide tech issue.   @CBSPhilly 
does anyone actually work at the dividend miles department? http://t.co/BgtJFmnEOT 
what's the deal with the flight computer network? 
my wife left her phone on flight AWE474 on Friday February 20th upon landing in Minneapolis. How can we get it back? Thanks! 
why the hell will you not put us in a hotel when you've stranded us. Your message says mechanical issues not weather. #usairways 
799 from AMS to PHL today- 3 of 4 flight attendants were downright rude and hostile and made the 8+ hour flight even worse. 
... What's going on at @PHLAirport ?!  I've been sitting at the gate for 45minutes. 
5 hours on the phone waiting for a call back to find my luggage #shameonyou 
hello! I never received a confirmation code for my flights (though they are confirmed--so says the automated reply). Any ideas? 
flight 2031, worst experience we've ever had on a flight. Regretting opening their air miles card #hotterandlongerthanhell 
Any update on the computer outtage affecting flights? Is this national or just Northeast? ETA on resolution? 
told me I deserved to be delayed because I booked the last flight and then I hear "the only inconvience is missing your flight" 
@AmericanAir just be prepared for a claim if that bag is lost ... Too many valuables to carry in my hands. #us2146 to #aa2924 
Gave up after more than 2 hours on hold. Still need that receipt; last time it was promised, it never arrived. Help?! 
#flight2031 the flight to Hell 
stuck on the ramp at DCA, US Air computer system crashed...everywhere. 
HI again! How you suggested I contacted u via phone, sent a mail with the original ticket &amp; the result: http://t.co/214i0RTIH4 
but the automated message says the line is too busy to join the queue! #stuckintheloop 
really? No meal vouchers for a 7 hour flight delay out of Virgin Islands... 
can't seem to find the pilots for our 6pm flight, never seen anything like it before #drunkpilots http://t.co/Zira2z3UDc 
I don't understand why I can't get my missing miles? I was on the flight, it was in my Dividend Miles Account… #help 
please keep Emily at you gso airport ticketing on staff she is amazing 
always letting me down. 👊 
after a crappy flight due to delays and rude staff members I'm happy to report after paying $25 to check my luggage it's ruined 
@AmericanAir  nvm my bad it's been an hour and a half #thanks 
who do I contact about my awful experience I had 2/15/15 with @USAirways Flight 713 BUF-CLT? 
So any ideas when the IT Geeks will plug in the servers so 639 can be on its way to PHX? 
@USAirwaysCenter My lost bag lands in Hartford at 639p tonight. Will it be delivered to Danbury CT tonight? 
what's going on in CLT? 
2 people working the counter at #dca? Massive lines. Poorly played. #winterstorm 
hopefully your crappy service improves as u become @americanairlines #angryairtravel #winterstorm 
@AuroraBIZ check your bag, @PHLAirport bag handlers broke into my suitcase and stole my camera, bag was returned in a trash bag 
What is happening at Reagan Airport DCA? Long lines and four people working checkIn! #unhappy #DCA 
can you please help me find my luggage since you're the one who lost it? Your customer service SUCKS. 
nothing like back to back delayed flights let hope this one isn't 12 hours like the last time. 
printer problems causing us to sit on the runway for 45 mins. Get it together. 
2nd February in a row- stranded us when we try to return from Cancun! No contact info- no way to rebook! #badcustomerservice 
the. Worst. Ever. #dca #customerservice 
really? 8 hr delay in Virgin Island and not even a food voucher. 
can I get a beer please. Flight #1715 
not Cancelled Flightling #837 because you don't want to put us in a hotel for night is our guess 
Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to Sabre being down. What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed? 
stuck at the gate in Charlotte, NC waiting for "release papers" and a fix for a broken computer system. 
no word on delay reasons @LGB but Twitter is aflame with flight tracking computer crash. Rumors. True or Not? 
@AmericanAir will one of you please answer the phone? 
Flt 4609 landed over half an hour ago. Not a single bag yet on the baggage claim. Hate you so much right now. 
pilot tells me that all @AmericanAir and US Airways flights across the country have stopped due to a computer system failure. 
been on hold for over and hour now. 
holding your passengers hostage during your computer crash is not customer friendly, let us off the plane or get us moving 
@AmericanAir 2hrs Late Flightr finally taking off😂😂😂 
what is going on with the computers? Why is my flight grounded? Why does your airline suck so much? #UnansweredQuestions 
#555PHLtoSLC this is happening now. 
I need help locating my bag. I arrived in Denver last night at midnight from charlotte but my  8am flight to Hayden/steamboat 
...was Cancelled Flightled and now I need to locate my baggage 
@AmericanAir Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to computers being down. What backup plan is in place for this?? 
@Truthh4 they didn't give you the wifi password? Smh 
when your routing system goes down which grounds all your long haul flights you should think about a #failover plan 
sucks. Delayed my mom's flight 2X, Cancelled Flightled it, delayed her flight again today,all for mech. issues.She had 2 sleep in airport! 
any way to tell our gate we are going? Stuck on tarmack, int'l flt FLT 878 going to ELM Gate F6 
@AmericanAir According to your costumer support your website is holding my money hostage and you cant do anything about it.. 
it's flt 4827 to ELM - still no gate and still have to make it thru customs 
pilot says that we are going to take off in 10 minutes. So maybe the systems came back online? 
pilot for flight 729 didn't show until after departure ⌚️ &amp; now there's a broken computer. Next time flying @United. #ALWAYSLate Flight 
sorry, we are in Philly. Should've told you that. 
A tweeted apology is not enough for delay fiasco. NONE for insult from gate agent is worse. Except for Mark N., all bad at CLT. 
your IVR hung up on me because of high call volume? I need help. Call me 
- why can't the gate agent on flight #759 provide an update? Seriously, this is ridiculous how long people have been waiting 
#stuck in Florida with no flights... Service sucks here. #nofood #nodrinks #nohelp 
That's 1h 10m waiting to get my bag, 1h40m of flight delays, plus the 2hrs of delay I had on the way out. Never flying you again. 
we've been waiting at the gate for 2 hrs, why are we now waiting to stow the luggage? 
2 hours and counting. ..what kind of travel voucher do I get for this?? 
please have your people hold flight 599 from Phoenix to San Jose.  We pulling up to the gate! Scheduled to depart at 5:40 
@AmericanAir pissing off thousands of East coast customers.  When the delay is longer than the flight,  you = fail 
You suck in Philadelphia.  Let us off this plane! #phl 
Cancelled Flightled the last part of a ticket and am confused from the email I received whether value remains. Is there someone I can ask? 
where's our luggage? Been waiting more than an hour! Flight 2118. 
I have received two reservation check-ins for two different flights for my one flight tomorrow morning. Need assistance ASAP 
you guys have to be the worst. We are flying into Philadelphia and have only two jetways available for an on time plane.#pisspoor 
what is wrong with you guys and your inability to get planes in and out of Philly on time. Our pilot gave us a answer that was bs 
flight 614 keeps telling a few more mins to take off its been an hour. First time with you not the best #lies #brokenpromises 
hire smarter IT people if your systems keep crashing instead of some of the mooks you man some of these airports with. #goDelta 
@AmericanAir Thank you for a couple of easy, hassle free flights today, professional and friendly staff made everything easy! 
@AmericanAir Any word on accommodations for the passengers on US 746 when they arrive in Charlotte? Lot of tired passengers here 
@PHLAirport this is the reason I avoid @PHLAirport and @USAirways like the plague. Glad to see this merger is working well. #dumb 
@PHLAirport how can a plane scheduled to come in on time and actually happen. Then you bozos don't have any room us. #incompetent 
@PHLAirport can you pm me w answer if flt to 4278 is still on time. Been on ground over an hr w no gate. Need help. Pls 
What is happening? Have been sitting in Philly for hours. Pls take care of Flight 759 to Chicago. At least least us know! #soLate Flight 
Another great flight #FunFlightAttendants. Thanks for showing my dad wonderful customer service. #flt635 #LAX #PHX #SundayFunday 
@AmericanAir. delay and mechanical issues on both my weekend flights. Ridiculous. Will tweet as long as we are delayed 
Can you provide me with info about checking strollers and car seats?  Costs?  Restrictions?  Need to bring 2 seats 1 stroller. 
Can you advise on what's happening with departure delays from CLT? 
rant cont... To top it all off, rescheduled flight to TPA at 10:10 is already delayed. How can they be that bad? 
thanks for three Cancelled Flightled flight and making us go from raleigh to charlote to lexington to philly. istead of raleigh to philly 
#fail when the inbound flight arrives after the scheduled outbound departure, and still "on time" http://t.co/k0MHZrJF6e 
flight 2120. Please get us a flight plan already. How is this an issue in 21st century? 
so you don't have a pilot now for #clt ✈ #ord for at least another hour. Why on earth would you board the plane? Makes no sense! 
over two hours on hold to talk to an agent..then it disconnects me.  been trying for two days! Wtf! Hire some CSRs u make $ now 
what is wrong in Boston? Why are only your plains not leaving tonight? Son needs to get back to state college, PA 
ur specialist said they would talk to the stewardess about not serving drunks drinks, REALLY how does that help 
@AmericanAir USAIR #703 has returned to PHL due to issues with the fire detectors. What happens next? 
PLEASE HELP need our plane to wait to go to #ELMIRA on Tarmac over an hr baggage took 45 and still not here thru customs 
so I guess you are ok with people being sexually assaulted on your flights nice customer service 
do you know what flight the pilots for 1581 are coming in on? Thanks. 
@AmericanAir Not providing pilots for your flights: is this a new feature of your merger? #efficencies 
@AmericanAir  worst customer service ever how can you let people be assaulted on your flights and do nothing about it 
your service at PHL is abysmal. An hour on the runway waiting for a gate, no information anywhere, missed my connection abysmal! 
@AmericanAir how is it possible that someone is drunk they bring a wheelchair for them but you keep serving them 
it's not often that an airline is so easy to work with. I needed to change my flight time and the attendants at MKE made my day! 
on top of that a dozen ppl missed connections and you have ONE person at customer service? Abysmal! 
@AmericanAir so does that mean @AmericanAir that you might care about my sister be assaulted on one of your flights 
great, thank you! 
Really a letter that says you will discuss serving drunks more drinks that doesn't help the current situation 
@GregWallace66 Yea, they will give you 5 cents on the dollar! 
I have contacted them but only got an automated response that won't give me the code. 
any idea when flight 703 to Miami will leave for a second time? 
why does this flight keep getting delayed Late Flightr and Late Flightr? 
got off stand by list and on earlier flight to DCA. What is the status of my checked bag? Was supposed to be on #4047 thanks 
what happens to frequent flyer miles earned once merger is complete with AA? 
your rude staff said" I don't care that we are out of market place food you're going on vacation and I have to work" nice huh 
thanks to the whole team for an on-time flight despite inclement weather http://t.co/eQePkkPSXM 
  US AIRWAYS DON'T CARE FOR CUSTOMERS. Worst experience today with US airways.. Myself, wife and toddler 
- had to call to find out I was re-booked tomorrow, why ask for my number an email for day of info 
do you have an email?? 
been trying to set up my phone interview for days, and hoping the position won't be filled because the link doesn't work. @USAirways 
@AmericanAir major issues getting out of Boston, but your crew has been exceptional. Let's see how things roll out in Philly. 
is holding my luggage hostage from flight 5182 
Can someone please answer my call. I have been waaaaaaiting!!! 
the entire flight crew on flight 738 from BOS to PHL is doing a wonderful job and making this experience not totally suck. 😊 
in line for 90 min after mechanical issues caused me to miss my flight. 1 rep for 20 upset people. http://t.co/XFWXsRwkHa 
how is it that the airport (DCA) and the airline mess up our flights, but also will not cover our hotel costs? At DCA for 5hrs... 
- flights 4500 AND 403 delayed for "crew availability?"  What gives? I'm getting to TPA 2.5 hrs past my scheduled arrival. 
 Interesting you forward compliments but never complaints!  World's worst airline #GoingForGreatnessFAIL 
@PHLAirport we don't control your stupidity in not having room to have a plane come in. You better not mess with us now. 
 flight missed due to mech issue. No food voucher, transported to different airport, no rental reimbursement 😡 
1st flight with U.S. Air Plane had mechanical issues. Wait 90 minutes for help from customer service. No help from management 
Southern Hospitality luggage delivery service from SAV is AWFUL. Great @ delivering empty promises but not luggage #8hrs&amp;waiting 
why won't you help me get my luggage back? I'm a teen trying to change the world in DC #Flight5182 #usairways 
I've been on hold for 90 minutes. This is terrible customer service. You messed up my reservation! http://t.co/oyLgeao7Y8 
45 minute delay for take off and 30 minute wait for checked bags? Really? 
Flight 4424 operated by @FlyRepublicAir (N813MA) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from Reagan National http://t.co/OSc9OFlol3 
Chairman Preferred with 518,758 lifetime miles. What is my US Air reward, no #firstclass upgrades on @AmericanAir as usual. 
So far....my phone wait time is longer than @ABCNetwork's #Oscars coverage. #WhatCustomerService 
- been on hold for more than 2.5 hours - this after not getting through after 2 hours on hold this morning with no answer - help! 
worst service at Reagan Int. I rarely post about a company or service, but I am so annoyed. Not weather reLate Flightd…incompetence. 
why the hell did you overbook a plane when you knew people actually had seat assignments. #inept #uncaring #piss poorplanning 
- how do I get an answer to my question?  Holding for hours , after 6x getting your message just said you aren't taking calls. 
- I wouldn't need to wait on hold for 6+ hours if your website worked correctly - please respond! 
been sitting at gate for over 25 min on us 728! What gives??? 
 "please call Late Flightr" is not acceptable - but neither is being on hold for 5+ hrs #onholdwith 
help! I've been on hold for almost two hours. Trying 2 get home. 
CLT, please send more than one cust svc rep to your cust svc counter to assist a line out the door. http://t.co/v24QNp3DOi 
- have dinner reservations in a few minutes -- and I've been trying to get through to you since BREAKFAST. #onholdwith 
follow/dm please 
Can you help with a seat assignment?  5 people flight 694, PHX to HNL, seats are split up.  Anything you can do will be great. 
What is with your lost &amp; found.  My wife lost her phone in Philly, &amp; followed your web instructions to call an 800#.  No answer. 
- just passed the 3 hour mark #onholdwith you for THIS call.  Gave up after 2.5 this morning. 
@PHLAirport always nice when a customer service manager threatens customers standing in his understaffed lines for the last hour 
delayed 2.5 hours @longbeachairport trying to get to @PHXSkyHarbor; give us an update, please??? 
Missed flight. Rude CSR. No flight till Tuesday. No answer on twitter. Help me out with a RT @pattonoswalt you're my only hope. 
@usair   idiots took our plane &amp; gave it to someone else. Fudgers!!!! Flight 799 from Philly to Orlando 
after 2 hrs of trying to reach real human, finally did and been on hold for 1:36 hrs for out of synch reservation. 
- Janet &amp; my DEN-PHL  flight Cancelled Flightled Saturday, USAIR rescheduled automatically &amp; notified us by email at no additional cost. 
Thanks for ruining my last night of vacation because I have to worry about my flight because y'all don't have record of it 
and I can't get through on any phones 
Today USAir Cancelled Flightled our rescheduled flight &amp; did not notify us except possibly to our home phone-not helpful since we are in CO 
Just discovered that they billed us $300 for the rescheduled flight, which cost me a second day of lost work. 
you're really fudgin up with all these delays 😡 #justwantmybed 
The fact we did not get notified hindered our ability to look for alternate flights before they were snapped up. 
Since I am a loyal USAir customer I am sure that they will make this up to me-right now I want to get home &amp; back to work. 
Instructions say to CALL. I'm just doing what it said to do. 
comedy of errors continues..." We can't get into our gate, there is a broken down truck in the way" #fail 
@PeterPiatetsky Ummmm I think US Air's computers@were@down for hours - my flight is 3 hours Late Flight. 
nightmare trying to get to Costa Rica from PHL today. Stuck in Miami and no one answers at 800 number. 
- you kind of screwed my day up, at least it was outbound, but you did save it by stranding me in a @RenHotels @MarriottRewards 
truly dissapointed when our flight is delayed and going to miss connection that we are expected to rebook our own flight???????? 
@AmericanAir you should partner w/ a different hotel in PHL, the clarion is proving to be very difficult &amp; not customer friendly 
any update on this flight?It's more than three hours delayed. Thank you. 
Have you issued a Memphis travel advisory for tomorrow? Winter weather coming through now. 
This is the worst flying experience of my life. Flight scheduled for departure at 5:44pm from Phl. 5+ hrs Late Flightr guess where I am? 
I made a reservation online but I didn't receive any confirmation email. My bank said the transaction went through. Can u help? 
- is stranding your customers, not reFlight Booking Problems them, and then not answering the phone the way you treat Platinum members? 
we flew out, through and into good weather. when we landed,  another technical issue with gate. improve service or lose customers 
I think it's a little weak sauce you have zero inflight entertainment for a 4 hour flight from Salt Lake to Philadelphia 
have you heard about the debacle at DCA? What is happening with our New Orleans flight? #wewanttoknow 
I'm tired of paying for luggage &amp; less than stellar customer service @AmericanAir. #notafanofyourmerger 
flight #703 Philly -&gt; Mia? Bwahahaha! Delayed 5+ hrs, were in the air 30 mins then turned back around. #usairwaysfail 
#PHL why does it take an hour to offload bags, especially after taking 30+ min to get a jetway to get off plane after landing? 
@AmericanAir have the most rude, unreliable, horrible company with equally rude, unreliable and horrible employees. Stay tuned. 
you are absolutely terrible at managing these delays... Been delayed and undelayed and delayed 6 times now. 10 AM office hours. 
now has stranded is in #Miami without updating any of the departure boards, and once they Cancelled Flightled the flight there was no... 
attendants at the gate. Enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us 
Looking for some help to recover an item I left on an airplane this evening 
give us no information and an attitude. 
@AmericanAir have been trying to call customer service since 9pm. After an hour, was disconnected. Spoke to no one 
@AmericanAir as soon as I call customer service to speak to a representative, I am disconnected 
absolutely worst experience of my life at PHL. 6 hrs, 1 failed departure, 3 gates, and ZERO communication or help!! 
and @AmericanAir aren't as merged as the marketing departments would have us believe. Maybe @Delta or @united can get me home? 
doesn't let u do stand by on flight due to checked bag causing u to get in 5 hours Late Flightr only to get to PHL &amp; bag didn't make it 
not given option for new flight! Why can't we get a plane PHL-MIA? 20years as an #eventprof this is worst travel experience ever 
have been waiting in an airplane for a total of 3 hours to take off between 2 flights today...this usually doesn't happen... 
making folks run from gate C29 to A18 to B11 with NO EXPLANATION and zero carts to transfer elderly and handicap. #PHL 
you are the worst. 
.... I've been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous 
looks like our bag has been rescued. Thanks! 
you reminded me today why I fly @SouthwestAir 
denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl @ 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg 
Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Time😡😡😡 
does anyone from your airline know how to do their job? 
had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh 
your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights. 
this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline 
it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly 
Thank you. I'll do that next time! 
or email? That's the purpose of sending you a tweet? @USAirways 
 ok my 4th try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible http://t.co/Ps9Q9RPSiL 
yet again your staff in Philadelphia  failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler 
#usairways lost a passenger today for not upholding their promise of excellent customer service!!! 
got this message on your site to call about my flight - just gave up after being on hold for 3 HOURS! http://t.co/5cDX2ROAE6 
the call hung up on me.. 
who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight 
now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep? 
Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!! 
has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled. 
is the worst airline to ever travel with. 
@landonschott he's fine, he really likes picking his own seat.... 
@PDQuigley any progress? Good luck, Patrick! 
hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST! 
you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service 
and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me! 
I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways. 
Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area. 
And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour! 
there's over 50 people in line and only one agent! 
I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight. 
But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on. 
you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly. 
Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia? 
sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line? 
And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long? 
Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience 
how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems? 
cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website.  Can you help? 
not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN 
IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR??? 
Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature. 
I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :) 
What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore? 
your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable 
pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this long😒 
I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways 
you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me. 
Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again. 
What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait. 
on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us. 
three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!? 
4469, thank you for asking. 
flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alternate? Thank you. 
YOU ARE THE BEST!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏 
How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls? 
merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it. 
wow, awful customer service. 
Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren't here 45 minutes Late Flightr 
as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise 
your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else 
so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help 
then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!! 
flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside &amp; out. #NotHappy 
Raleigh to Chicago and no #firstclass upgrade. Must be flying AA 'the screw USAir Elite, after we bailed them out' Airline 
forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. Why even allow it? #pissed 
hello??? Anyone there? 
the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail 
Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome 
not the case.. They sent me a email with a link, I'll show you.. @USAirways http://t.co/hb799CCo0t 
Seriously. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. #wtf 
Is your refund system down? 
You guys are screwing up my trip. Thanks for nothing. #lazy 
@hegshmeg O” thank you for that elaborate response 
We take Late Flight to a whole new level! 
Can you help me with a refund.  the phone guy couldn't help.  The website won't let me submit a reply. 
thank you for the apology 
: We Suck -- And Pass the Savings on to Us! #usairwaysfail

Do your flight schedules to - from Quintana Roo, Mexico reflect their newly adopted time zone change to EST? 
 I just reserved a flight with my companion certificate, where do I mail the certificate for verification???? THX!!! 
first, luggage got stuck in a different city, now I get them back today &amp; one of your employees stole a pair of gloves from me! 
I'm referring to email like this.  Just tell people when they GET the upgrade. Otherwise, we know already. http://t.co/N8UvCLMADA 
: When You've Got to Get There, We've Got Excuses! #usairwaysfail 
is alright with me. Please give Scott F at BDL a bonus for excellent customer service 
Will the nightmare ever end? Just found out our flight today is delayed due to "ground handling delays affecting a prior flight." 
On hold 2hrs after my flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; "Anthony" was beyond rude and not helpful! @AmericanAir they're weighing you down. 
Thank you. The website crashing for me. 
I relied on US Airways, and that was my mistake. Awful customer experience. 
you denied a mom her AM flight because she NEEDED her breast pumping parts on a full flight? Please FIX this ASAP!! #freeflight 
Thanks! 
Your CLT baggage crew deserves a #kudos. I had to run to make my connection. And my bags still made it! #CustomerService 
I'm supposed to fly through Dallas. Can you help me get a new itinerary? 
I will. Is it down or is just me? 
please fix the very unproductive check in process at @DCA. 20 check in stations and 2 people working them. What a total mess!!!! 
can you add my KTN to an existing reservation? 
will all flights out of DFW be Cancelled Flightled today? 
@AmericanAir on hold for 8 hours yesterday w/o speaking to an agent on hold again w/ 2 phones ~30 mins let the bashing begin... 
Decided to be a good sport and give you guys another shot. Flight delayed. Again. 
4473.  She just called to say it's a runway clearing problem of all things. 
Thank you. 
Will tweet all day until I get 
a live cust rep. I will make sure the world knows you don't care about your customers health. 
I am appalled. My departure with you was all messed up and now on return i am supposed to fly alone with two very sick kids 
Discovered our flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday at 3:30PM - @americanairlnes finally notified us our flight was Cancelled Flighted at 0316 AM 
I've been on hold for 30 minutes and counting. #unacceptable 
i worked with you and bought my own rental car when you failed to get me to the location i paid to get to and now.... 
&amp; @AmericanAir what are your weight restrictions for carry on luggage? Can find measurements but not weight restrictions. TIA 
you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date 
@AmericanAir - Burned a lot of time and cell minutes working through this flight issue - hopefully we fly home in the morning. 
i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying.. 
I will NEVER fly us airways or american again and I will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly 
There is nothing on my USAir CC at this point, but the email stated I would be charged.  Thanks for the reply. 
First the pilot was Late Flight, now it's maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable. 
@AmericanAir can someone help me with some travel issues today? 
already spent 60 mins today handling this for my minor child. Shame on you for treating a 15 year old girl like this. 
getting extremely frustrated w/ the phone/online service for merging frequent flyer miles. 
thx for delayed checkin on noon flt to mia then forcing me to take Late Flightr flts which were delayed. Cincy to Miami in 13 hrs! #fast 
couldn't be more thankful to your #orf and #dca crews on the ground and in the air today for help with a sick kid and a lost bag! 
@AmericanAir I need to move a reservation due to weather in the middle part of the U.S.  I would like to change departing airport 
Thanks for the information! 
I need to speak with a live person. I've had it with the recordings. I was told on Sat that we'd have our luggage by yest. 
@AmericanAir me after arriving at 8:41am for a flight scheduled to depart at 8:57am. doors closed, no agents 
I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can't get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use! 
@AmericanAir at 9:05am after the plane left: "why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?" 
@AmericanAir "ma'am the doors close 10 mins prior to departure" "but I was here 20 mins before?!?" laughter from the 2 agents 
4914 from PHL to BGM. I cannot believe this has happened 2x in under two weeks! 
no my flight plans have been delayed until tuesday due to your computer crash 
your phone system is not working at all I have been bumped again so now I am at 3 times I need to get out of mco 
Cancelled Flights flight Tampa to Philadelphia today due to runway conditions yet tonnes of USAirways flights landing there today, explain! 
here's to sitting on hold for 4 hrs flight Cancelled Flighted and they disconnect twice. #fend4urself #stranded #diverted 
@AmericanAir 3 hours on hold got rebooked on a new flight yesterday. I asked for a new itinerary/confirmation email to be sent 
@AmericanAir 28 hours Late Flightr still no email. work supervisor needs documentation to approve last minute vacation day request 
8 hour delay pho-mia, your airline is bad and getting worse, Foolish for american to merge.  You treat your customers like crap 
Wife and I flew to Italy recently. Bought tickets via Finnair, flights operated by USAir. Didn't get dividend miles credited. 
@AmericanAir ok the app doesn't seem to be working. just use the mobile site... http://t.co/4kLfywwMq1 
2 days in a row, not buying it. I suggest you review your policy w respect to unaccompanied minors, should have had a seat on Sun 
Strike Three!!! You guys suck!!! 
thanks for Cancelled Flighting flight 5097 today. Now missing required training. Not a happy customer. 
@AmericanAir call the number listed? sure! by next Friday, I should get a real live person on the line http://t.co/8TJUuM22dD 
@AmericanAir taking off now. if I don't have a private jet to bora bora by the time I land, I'm calling Oprah 
flight US1562 from RIC2DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday &amp; I was on hold w/ cust. service from 6-10pm EST...4 hours, no answer... 
Customer service is dead. Last wk, flts delayed/Cancelled Flighted. Bags lost 4 days. Last nt, flt delayed/Cancelled Flighted.  No meal voucher? 
Seriously doubt that as I am still sitting inside at the gate. 
but my bag is still missing 
What is going on with flight 1826 from PHL to PHX? 10 mins to estimated departure nobody has board and no update. 
I understand that, and when I'm attempting to change the information so they are identical, it tells me to call a # 
I would appreciate a call regarding a HORRIBLE experience I had with a gate agent. Was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me. 
or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever? 
would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room. 
@acnewsguy can you give me a # for US Air in philly to talk to a real person? Acarl4@hotmail.com 
thanx but this isn't my first rodeo. Done &amp; done yesterday. No results or comm, unless u count status: bags lost &amp; claim filed. 
if you DM me we can take this offline. Would love more info on location of lost bags. Any help is appreciated. 
Going to Manchester, UK now i'm going to miss a wedding. You going to rebook that too? Why have you chosen to Cancelled Flight my flight?? 
congrats on treating your customers the worst way possible. I know plenty of other ppl who have had horrible experience w you too 
DOMINICK L. at La Guardia airport NYC gives the absolute best customer service! Thanku! Checking in made easy! 
2102 DCA-BOS. Cancelled Flightled after making us wait over an hour. If I fly USAir every week can you upgrade my status proactively? 
If my flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled every week I might as well be in business class. 
rebooked for Tuesday. Arriving too Late Flight for on Tuesday to start the class. Cancelled Flightled the trip. 
website isnt working and I cant talk to any1 on the phone to check flight status out of dfw. Roads are awful and cant get there 
Pilot pleads to let boarding begin for full flight #1937 while waiting for 4th flight attendant. Denied by mission control. Grrrr 
I cant make it to airport, roads are to bad in DFW and no one is answering the phones and the website is down?How do I reschedule 
thank you, but it says the website is down 
i will be Cancelled Flighting my us airways credit card and choosing other airlines after my experience this week. 
they told me to call back Late Flightr 
no you call me. 
is struggling. had me on hold for 25 minutes, kicked me back to the start, then said they couldnt handle the amount of calls 
FYI your customer service rep Carol is an absolute delight. So pleasant to with with and rebooked me in lightning speed! Thanks! 
thanks for a subpar travel experience and it's not even over yet #stepitup 
I'm sure the people are working very hard, but the systems should assist with IVR prompting, offering call backs, hold wait times 
: Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail 
Will you pick up your phone then? 
I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on 
That is the height of rudeness, and without question the worst customer service I have ever experienced. 
We have submitted the customer relations form and await your response! 
what's going on with your website &amp; mobile app??? Help!!! 
1899. Thanks 
603 &amp; 2705 DFW to PSP thank you! 
@HutchinsJim Yes, I made the flight and got my workout in too. 
over the phone. I called the 6170 number and she picked up almost immediately. 
 Houston Gate 17 customer Service needs to treat people with respect. There are hardly people waiting! #chillpill #usairwaysfail 
Another dead end.  They only handle AA L&amp;F.  They gave me the same failed # I already had. 610-362-7498(99) VM full.  #lost 
I listed my baggage claim number.  Have them call me, my number is on the ticket.  I had to use Lady Speed Stick this morning. 
: You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail 
@AmericanAir hey since you    f*%#ed my wknd can I have day pass to admirals club or meal coupon or free coke? {blank stare} 
Hi guys! Are flights 5594 and 3937 still on time? The site and app are both down and I can't check. Thanks! 
/ @AmericanAir don't forget without your customers you would be out of business! #epicfail #usairwaysfail 
I'm unable to check in for flight 2119 BOS-DCA and haven't heard if flight was Cancelled Flighted/rescheduled. Any updates?? 
how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating 
we called and were able to get rescheduled. Thank you for the quick responses today!! 
Your system is affected by the weather? 
When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person... 
Hi, can you attach my AA FF# 94LXA62 to reservation E2KVM4. Thansk! 
thanks! Any idea when it will be resolved? I'd like to purchase my ticket! 
great operation you guys are running. More mechanical issues, and now taping piece of plane together LOL http://t.co/I5V9wfbtuE 
she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best! 
Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever. 
delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077 
@jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn't book a flight via calling either :( 
called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me? 
contact via FB messages, Twitter DM or text? 
/ @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time 
Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help? 
I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane 
is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days 
how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up 
Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways 
it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization. 
Bag policy says stroller OR car seat.  We need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller.  Should I just call for details? 
how long for a reply 
takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail 
Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online? 
any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold 
And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered? 
I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!! 
now my rebooked connection is delayed. 
okay, great. Thank you! 
Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody... 
They were breathing very heavily. but were super helpful. Thank you. 
Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost &amp; no ownership from @USAirways 
booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service 
trying to book award travel leaving on red-eye Sunday night after midnight. Should I book the date in Sunday or Monday? 
horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight 
nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits 
don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me 
usually "sorry" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk. 
Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! 👍 
your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time. 
lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA. 
when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information. 
now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm. 
@AmericanAir - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry 
sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents! 
flights &amp; "customer relations" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE 
is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given. 
site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX. 
oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest. 
anyone there to help? Still on hold... 
why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave. 
I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers. 
seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground! 
Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need. 
yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on. 
is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them. 
4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; JAN . JAN &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go. 
hi. You lost my father's wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me. 
well that is not going to help. I'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs &amp; my client wants his ff nbr in the record he's elite wAA 
really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx. 
stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy 
what's the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac? 
I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box. 
going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please! 
So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward. 
back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK 
take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules. 
can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic "sorry" email back 
US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand. 
my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing 
US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange. 
One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity... 
Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq 
US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods. 
US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard. 
US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment. 
I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all 
US 728 returned to gate to get "MEL" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone? 
US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us. 
US 728 Wait, now a gate opened. Back we go. (Good, maybe we can get off.) 
US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. 
US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment. 
How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x 
@AmericanAir trying to chg ticket for staff member leaving org before she can fly.We're a nonprofit-can't you make an exception? 
thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable 
US 728. Refuel; we've sat for so long. Pilot announces where the truck is. "Look, over there to the left!" Actual announcement. 
US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen! 
@marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline 
US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances. 
US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr. 
you guys lost my luggage 
US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr. 
- thanks, I hope so. Maybe you can put in a good word for me? ;-) 
It's 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully. 
im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at Dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times 
how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that? 
made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help! 
@AmericanAir shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!) 
delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again 
too Late Flight. 
Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility 
@CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever 
I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today. 
our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down. 
I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short 
I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready 
customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would. 
if I apply for ur credit card, do you automatically get the companion certificate or do I have to wait for it? 
you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly. 
just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got. 
1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down! 
I have a flight voucher/confirmation code but there is no where for me to enter it on your checkout page while Flight Booking Problems. Pls help 
is there an additional charge for a golf bag with clubs , shoes, and golf balls, if that's the only piece of luggage you check? 
- Huge props to Parizad at checkin in Sacramento for her help on Friday to get 3 of us home when other airlines were delayed 
I made it! Thanks for the help! 
please fix your reservations phone system.  The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days!  #goodgriefpeople 
sorry I didn't realize I wasn't following you 
following you now 
cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx. 
you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before. 
if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is. 
hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David. 
Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight 
is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time 
so it's a $25.00 bag fee for a golf bag on a domestic flight? 
I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me 
what happens if it isn't located 
with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off 
the jetway because he felt I was disrespectful. I have never been treated this way particularly when I was trying to be a good c 
owes Tammy from the Winston-Salem call center for keeping me as a customer! 
Am I allowed to carry on a suit bag and carry on bag? My suit bag will hang like a jacket would. It is soft sided, 48" 
we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright 
@united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday. 
citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I'm so upset 
this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable. 
you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them 
even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me. 
doesn't take into account the $450 it cost 2 rent a car 2 drive home 
look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock... 
and I would have been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and say we misunderstood each other until he went on a 
thank you for putting me on a flight that will be leaving Late Flightr than the original flight I was booked on. 
power trip. I felt completely threatened and unsafe and I am so angry. Derrick Bussey.  DCA. Would like to reiterate that I was 
OFFERING to give up my bag which you usually have to force passengers to do. I am in a state of shock. 
the exhaustion of traveling n runnin thru the airport and tryin 2rent a car n not killin myself my family or anybody on the road 
I will never fly @USAirways again 
only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags 
I'm shutting my data off for the flight. I want some response by the time I land.  You have 2 hours. 
 how does one downgrade a flight? 
honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600????? 
Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now. 
been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous 
4 great flights with no delays! Thank you! 
I checked in "Standby for 1st Class" only to find I am "not on the list". This merger is a pain. 
I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines. 
on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues. 
thanks for the reply. On a good note, the pilot nailed the landing. Seriously. Kudos. 
- HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP 
ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day. 
I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks. 
awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH? 
direct flights to SFO leaving from same airport with @VirginAmerica and @united - can you please put me on one of those? 
I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane 
She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten 
no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded. 
ok thanks 
would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me. 
THANK YOU for resolving the issue. On direct flight to sfo from @united 
is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach? 
I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help! 
PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously 
patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time. 
And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat 
do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls! 
your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me. 
your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews 
also, can you explain why, when I checked in, on the US Airways site, &amp; picked "Standby for 1st" I was not put on the list? 
@hhagerty that's a lie. 
IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU 
great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me 
your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service 
can you help chairman? I am on flight 686 PHX connect 599 SJC will miss connection can you reroute please. 
why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways 
New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think? http://t.co/WbhbljJkS7 
can you priv chat to help chairman reroute 
I am good. I just did not understand the terminology.  but the merger brings new verbiage 
why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app? 
management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you. 
Your "moveup" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am... 
Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA) 
and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME. 
Have you just given up? 
but question :  if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back ? http://t.co/LfT7QD23Sy 
I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice. 
it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with. 
24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination. 
while I’m asking… 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came &amp; greeted me &amp; thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat. 
I asked if that was SOP, and they said “It is now.” But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not? 
horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05 
as far as being delayed goes… Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news! 
yes, thanks but took forever 
so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail 
Can you follow, so I can DM you? 
strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays 
 I will never fly us airways again. 
&amp; @AmericanAir planes in #grandcayman http://t.co/GX7QbtckBr 
customer service at its best! Rachel S.  took great care of us at the PHX airport. http://t.co/HG7vEqhGHy 
4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable 
@Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening "in front" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing 
i have a question. i need to talk to someone by email. Can you give me your email address? Thanks. 
is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened. 
 can you help me out? 
@VincesViews  there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy 
 I need to email customer service for help and a question, can you please provide the email address? 
I have submitted my request. I would appreciate a call by 9am eastern. Thank you. 
#686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold? 
Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight. 
@AmericanAir explain how come I can get a free upgrade on US as an exe plat but not exit row seating w/out paying. confused 
@AmericanAir need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose @Delta #rude 
 has me on my toes whether I'm going to make my flight back to Boston tonight 
please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4 
and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits... 
i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them. 
Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues. 
1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD 
and despite tailwind… Will still be Late Flight. 
I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs 
yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... 😉 what about the impossible connection that started this? 
I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler. 
very embarrassing. 
what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service. 
I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip 
seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible 
i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again 
I’d suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely &amp; relevant schedule to prevent this in the future. 
what's going on with US Airways flight 805?   Why diverted to Charlotte? 
just now but no general announcement 
should, but didn’t. 
Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you? 
little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options. 
not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed. 
I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645 
I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help 
It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone 
sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways. 
I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work? 
I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best 
changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never. 
good work by flight 1798 crew.  #Chairman's recognition even in coach.  Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly.  What's up with this? 
is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening 
every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola. 
#NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain 
@AmericanAir Can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights? 
1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers 
Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow. 
@PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously? 
#FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE 
On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys. 
and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo 
did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time. 
hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow. 
@AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell 
I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back 
I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold. 
I've been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren't showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc &amp; airline #SwitchingBoth 
#DividendRewards Urgently need to speak with a CS rep. My 50K miles havent shown &amp; I've fulfilled all reqs. Flight Booking Problems flights today 
@joyadventuremom there are breastfeeding momma's watching this story all over the country! Better work on a faster response :) 
- 53 minutes on hold for a reservation? 
I've been on hold for over an hour.  Not doing so well in the customer service department.  #weak 
Thanks for getting back to me. I called that number earlier but no option to leave vm and just rings with busy tone 
no worries, your flight attendant took care of it. 
Expedia reserved a ticket for me and 2 more for a USAW flight but only issued 1. They are not responsive.Thoughts? 
  Not good. On hold for over an hour. http://t.co/wSgYckCIIO 
yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing! 
: Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable. 
well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat 
yes, with Delta! 
finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks. 
no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but 
Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL 
travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund 
... I f@$%ing hate you. 
you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this. 
that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH 
has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being. 
you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you. 
was transf, held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I'd seen was gone.  Had to get supv. 
thank you. 
 US1799 CLT-&gt;SFO in first no desert, no snack basket. Incoming was on time ? What’s up? 
it is my fault but i bought online and i get twice why i buy twice it fault but i bougth ticket jfk to mccaren and usairways ++ 
but i bougth mc caren to jfk with same agency and delta airways . Delta refund money but usairways doesnt accept to refund 
Well, that's a problem considering I need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do? 
yes, but I had to pay more for another flight to get me out tomorrow since there weren't anymore for tonight...not fun :-/ 
cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service.
#socialtantrum 
my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person. 
- No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account. 
Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I'm a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues! 
Disgusted with your poor customer service. U wrongfully remove &gt; 65,000 miles from my Dividend Miles and no live person, 
terrible service 
thank u i wiil write after call  travel agency 
if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed 
is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight. 
Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings 
THE GRACE OF GOD, I MADE IT! “@USAirways: @__RWG__ We don't have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.” 
yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens. 
really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it's 11:30pm #NoExcuses 
yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said! 
done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update?? 
honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else. 
membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help. 
flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel 
I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words. 
not yet. But we will see shortly. 
charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold 
Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo 
screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn't let me on the plane because we were (1/4) 
- It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having 
 - I had 20,748 miles in  my account and was informed I'd forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I 
 you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card 
 I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles 
No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here. 
 Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open
-- My request to merge the accounts is denied 
  No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail 
The help/complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight 
 My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com 
  My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles 
 Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent. 
 I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems. 
 I've never been treated this badly 
 A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note. 
 Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death. 
Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare? 
thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can't go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1 
thanks very much! I got thru on the phone &amp; everything is fine. Just love the website &amp; app ! Thanks for working on it! 
my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14 
- thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution? 
flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired 
can't get back lost time 
the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH 
yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am. 
I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me. 
yes but again valuable time has been lost 
is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail 
Thank You for your empathy there is more to this story than just the luggage but thank you for reaching out 
: You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail 
pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail 
are people going to answer our calls? 
great crew for flight 504 PHX to YVR tonight! Friendly, efficient. Awesome job. 
it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case! 
thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer. 
Excited that I'll be flying from Syracuse to interview in Dallas on Friday for the FA position- this is a goal &amp; dream of mine! 
some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $. 
it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU. 
Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you. 
 Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought. 
My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic 
I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours. 
nope not yet... 
Changing my flights with no explanations and still don't have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service 
I just spent 3.5 hours and got nowhere. Entire experience #epicfail 
I am a UK citizen. Is there a UK number I could try? 
I've been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation. 
flight 1946 out of clt this morning.  It's snowing here.  Should i head out to the airport? 
nah it's for my flight next week.. inside my Chairman 7-day window but you still haven't released the last open First seat to me 
, since jan 22 have been on 10 flights. Why the disrespect in CLT, flt #2063 at 2:50pm on 18feb to DCA? just asked herba question 
asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. She said, "because I told you to!" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable! 
Flight 830 CLT to Phl. I was 1st on list.Someone else got spot. Rude employee in coach. Wouldt give ID. Said he was cute red head 
@AmericanAir Day 3 &amp; still no luggage Chkd http://t.co/MbLTALr4BS STATUS=AWAITING ASGMNT TO DRIVER Since yest 10:15am 
@united two broken airplanes, two days Late Flightr and I'm stranded after a funeral and missing out on my last semester of #college. 👍 
what's wrong with the plane? Flt 581 
just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online 
5203 and we're just sitting 20 feet from an open gate 
well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy 
pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu 
nope, they just announced we're headed back to the gate. 
They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out 
why aren't you updating flight status/delays? 
knows customer service!! Thank you for starting our 2 week vacay on an amazing note! Thank you sarita!!! 
Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever. 
need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers. 
can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please. 
1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q'd to take off. And we checked our bags. 
&amp; @AmericanAir: 1 flight Cancelled Flightled yesterday and now a delay today has robbed my daughter of 2 days with her grandparents. Thanks 
R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature! 
We're back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we'll get thete eventually. So thanks. 
can i please have someone call me 781 879 4505 
How do I add my TSA Pre number to an existing reservation? 
Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!! 
seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours? 
I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏 
I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets 
Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE. 
should give me free baggage for this mess 
been trying for weeks no use 
Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn't been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst 
There is no reFlight Booking Problems the event I'm flying to attend. Waiting for jetway driver??? STILL ON TARMAC??? 
oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn't fix the problem 
they have all of this at hotels. Still don't have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/JIEYCat1Ek 
still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service. 
Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out. 
@AmericanAir our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating! 
Thanks again for ruiningmy vacation.  You all are the best for this.  Could not have done it without you. 
OK we are on DAY 11 trying to  book a flight for 4.  Ur system STILL says "due to weather….call back Late Flightr"  #outofbusiness ? 
- Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to "bad weather" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone? 
another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU 
i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online.... 
then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50. 
been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full 
Been on hold for 40 minutes, calling because my flight is delayed.  This type of service in not acceptable. 
see you on board tomorrow 
When you are deciding to wreck a vacation... is losing luggage from a Cancelled Flighted flight your "go to" maneuver? 
You should be prepared for Weather. All I want to do is find out if I can take train to PHL to catch my connection. 
hey!!  Yeah last time I got a phone call when flight was Cancelled Flightled from DCA to BOS 
I keep getting hung up on. PLEASE respond so I can book a ticket with you. I won't be able to buy one unless I speak to someone! 
HELLO!! Is anyone behind your twitter account? #badcustomerservice 
your CSR in PHL suck.   Flt 3883 gets cx'd,  i get rebooked to the next day?  On standby for 4011. Not hopeful. 
like they will call me? I'v been trying since yesterday and no one is answering... 
haha no worries you guys are the best!  +1 for spelling my name correctly 
I will NEVER travel US Airways again. Flew in from LA to DC last night and for the 2nd time on this airline my bags didn't arrive 
So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time! 
I'm glad @Beamske retweeted otherwise you would have to ignore the numerous tweets I sent. You all are fucking amazing 
is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt 
@Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002 
@Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing. 
has the worst customer service. Can't even get through to a rep you gotta be kidding me 
Is there a phone line to call into that isn't being affected by "bad weather"? Trying to book a vacation, here... 👀 
still on hold...1 hr 27 mins....thank god for chairman status. status match @Delta? 
I made it- thx. 
Thank you, although we're using our miles from our card and Flight Booking Problems companion tickets which can only be booked over the phone. 
Been on hold for over 5 hours! I believe I was overcharged $200 for my flight, I need an immediate explanation. HELP 
I've been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate. 
Is it possible to Cancelled Flight my reservation online? 
If I’m unable to use my departing flight can I still use the returning flight? 
how much is it to check golf clubs on a flight. They might be oversized 
2day: no coffee &amp; 1 working toilet.  Then I read domestic airlines whining re: foreign competition.  Coincidence?  No  #openskies 
can I check bags through to my final destination even though I bought separate tickets from IAD to PHL  and PHL to Israel? 
Ok thank you…I call from Spain to US for seating assistance! 
Hi! On my dividend miles account I accidentally listed my newly married name as opposed to my legal name. I am trying to book 
an award travel ticket but cannot since it is under a different last name. I simply need to change it 
to my legal last name. So it's not technically a name change,
I just used the wrong name 
what's the charge for oversize? Not overweight 
but I've been trying to call them since yesterday and I keep getting hung up on? Can you get me through to them?? 
trying to use chairman upgrade cert for flt 740 on 2/26/14 but being told not an option with 10 open seats? How? Thanks 
any direct number to dividend miles account info? Every Time I try them I get actually hung up on 
if I qualify for free 1st checked bag, is that applied at checkin? Same for using companion tickets? 
167 minutes?  "Im not trained in that". Cmon. Can't you do better than that? 
I didn't make a reservation yet. It's about changing name on my dividend miles account 
so I can make a reservation 
thanks !!! 
my bag is still lost and I can not get anyone on the phone to assist me and the tracking updates have stopped 
I did but the more eyes I have looking for Pandu the better chance I have of bringing him home. 
sadly that didn't help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!! 
...2 hours on the plane, they at least got us on a direct flight a couple hours Late Flightr on United 
not going as planned is an understatement. My flight was just changed AGAIN. If it weren't for a family emergency, I'd Cancelled Flight. 
is there a phone number or email address to customer service? 
- First impressions are hard to reverse.  A horrible first experience with you.  Will never fly with you again!!! 
I left my personal stuff on US4551 from PHL-BOS about an hour ago. Went baggage, was told plane left to call 800# 
thank you very much. 
- 800# referred me back to baggage services but I left the airport. I was on seat 17A 
She spoke with someone this AM and was told that breast pumps aren't medical equipment and that she should have "planned better." 
I don't want your sympathy I want someone to make an effort to find my bag 
 2 calls &amp; wasted 3 hrs on hold to change my coming divided awards weather reLate Flightd flight. Y'all disconnected me 2x. Please help. 
Need to talk to a person about my bag. Waiting on hold for two hours. Bag s!b delivered last night. Online says not found. 
And, the helpful employee who changed her boarding zone so that she would have space for her pump is now being disciplined #fail 
@AmericanAir I love you guys &amp; I'm gonna let you finish, but I've been on hold for 1 hour trying to book a flight w/ my voucher. 
It was this saturday during all the snow in the DC area.  Excited the flight was not Cancelled Flightled but sad he went missing. 
and now you can't even accommodate us by letting us fly in to another airport?! Horrible service for your fault!!! 
"Airport snow removal method #22..."
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/0JJT4X3YxG 
great job today from your team with a challenging weather delay on flight 1925 out of Charlotte. #travel #friendlyteam 
Forget reservations. Thank you to the great leadership at your company, I've Cancelled Flighted my flight. Once again, thank you. 
how can a person go from number one on a standby list to number twelve in three hours?  Should I be super platinum diamond status 
You have no idea how upset and frustrated I am right now. I'll be sure to follow through with never flying with you again. 
where is your email address? Its not on this page: http://t.co/5cwH1yfOow 
44 minutes on hold so far. And still haven't spoke to a human. Never using you again. 
59 minutes now. Nice customer service you got going on. 
I want to love you! 43 minutes on hold! Help me understand why I switched loyalty programs. http://t.co/cHGy5yrVka 
RT @Dmoukdarath: Nice, another delay with @usair second one this trip. Left engine leaking...what's next?? #USAIR #nothappy 
@AshleyKAtherton Over an hour on hold so far 
already did it. One person said they couldn't do anything another said she didn't know why the first person we talked 2 said that 
@AmericanAir how does a pilot forget log book? Been waiting on plane for 45 mins!! #AlsoNoDrinkCartComingAround 
There is an error w/ my preferred status &amp; I'm not able to reach an agent via phone. Travel Friday. Need resolved - contact info? 
any travel advisory coming for the Carolinas?  Bad weather! 
we even offered to fly in to another airport and they said they couldn't do that. No explanation why they can't. 
u didn't bother following up, we booked with @Delta.  @Delta understands cust srv: provided lunch 4 delays &amp; upgraded seats! 
How do I get a receipt for a change fee when I originally booked with miles? 
after being assured by the pleasant woman at gate B11 in Albany, NY that life's not perfect, I'd heard enough. 
- been standing at the gate for 45 min trying to go standby bc I will miss my connection. No help! Do NOT fly US AIRWAYS! 
Why can't I check in online for a flight tomorrow am? 
If I know I left something on my last flight (as I literally had to run to make my connection), how can I retrieve it please? 
thank you!! 
standby so far for two of us. With snow storm hitting Iowa tomorrow we could be stuck here for two days. 
that is certainly not the impression she's under. 
Sadly I'm currently booked on one of your flights tomorrow that I will be changing if I can. 
getting sorted, thanks 
did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24 
Yes. Confirmation number and all. 
question, friend flight got Cancelled Flightled. How can he book be flight? Leaving CHS to Philly to Germany 
I forgot my password and I don't know if my username is correct, and i want to use my miles, what i have to do?? 
ur "response" was: my "inconvenience was of no matter." U wanted me sit for 3 xtra nights in the city w/out comp! #donotflyusair 
thank you! I will be calling you! #CheapOairChat 
Said only way to get on plane about to leave that would make my connection was a $75 fee. Instead of earlier, I am now Late Flightr! 
I have two tight connections in #Charlotte and #Frankfurt 
thanks for making me miss my meeting in Dallas. 700 dollars down the toilet 😊 
DeeDee and Lynn S. have been great here in PHX; Richard P. here was a jerk. Rude to us and our parents for no reason. 
I need help about a ticket. DM me 
Why haven't you issued a travel advisory for Charlotte Wednesday night and Thursday? 4-6 inches of snow. 
I cant get anyone on the phone to help with award travel.Purchased extra miles and 10 minutes Late Flightr the miles needed was raised. 
Well I did miss it. But gate agents had rebooked boarding pass waiting when I landed. Time for lunch &amp; a beverage. Easy cheesy 
thanks 4 making it impossibly expensive 2 change 2 a flight leaving less than 24 hrs earlier than my reservation #1lesscustomer 
I've been on hold to change a date on a ticket for over 3 hours. Can someone please assist me? Unacceptable. 
will you be issuing a travel advisory for CLT for Thursday?  A significant snow storm is in the way Wednesday night. 
Been stuck for 40+ minutes due to lavatory issues. No beverages. No snacks. No customer service. Flt 645 to PHO... #fail #refund 
I finally got through on the phone after a 2 hour wait time. 
ok...i know doors close ~10 minutes before takeoff. stop telling me my flight will leave in 20 minutes when we haven't boarded. 
shout out to Cathy at the Vegas airport check-in for hooking us up! 
always fun to get screwed out of an earlier flight (that isn't full) #crummyservice #whydidntiflysouthwest #goodluckamericanair 
flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can't resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail 
agree! Richard P. Literally ripped up our tixs in our faces and made rude, inappropriate comments to us and our family. Awful! 
we were moved to a delta direct. Thank you for the accommodations! 
is not the new @AmericanAir is more like the new @SpiritAirlines. Love AA. Not impressed with the subpar planes and gate agents. 
you're killing me from the inside 
never received such horrible service or treated so poorly as Richard P. today. No excuse for attitude &amp; ripping up our tickets! 
just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite 
Fortunately you have staff like Lynn S. and DeeDee who actually understand customer service and simply being NICE. 
is a DM possible if you aren't following me? 
and when will one of these agents be available to speak? 
 is there a better time to call? My flight is on Friday and I need to change it. Worried I may be on hold until then.
